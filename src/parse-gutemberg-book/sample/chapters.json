    "text": "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of TheAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was madeby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was thingswhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  Inever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was AuntPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, sheis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, whichis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got sixthousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it outat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the yearround--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglasshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it wasrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regularand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't standit no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogsheadagain, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up andsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if Iwould go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and shecalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm byit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing butsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thingcommenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to cometo time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, butyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a littleover the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter withthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In abarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and thejuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and theBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by andby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; sothen I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock indead people.Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But shewouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I musttry to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  Theyget down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she wasa-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing athing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course thatwas all right, because she done it herself.Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with aspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and thenthe widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then foran hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch uplike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she wouldsay, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try tobehave?”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wishedI was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wantedwas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it forthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so Imade up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because itwould only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the goodplace.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around allday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't thinkmuch of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyerwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was gladabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and theneverybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window andtried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I feltso lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and theleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, awayoff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and adog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was tryingto whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and soit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heardthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell aboutsomething that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and socan't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every nightgrieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had somecompany.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and Iflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge itwas all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that wasan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scaredand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in mytracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tiedup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  ButI hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe thatyou've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't everheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killeda spider.I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn'tknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the towngo boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller thanever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst thetrees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly Icould just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there.  That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out thelight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slippeddown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me."

    "text": "WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end ofthe widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape ourheads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and madea noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him prettyclear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretchedhis neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:“Who dah?”He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood rightbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it wasminutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so closetogether.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but Idasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are withthe quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain'tsleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, whyyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jimsays:“Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here andlisten tell I hears it agin.”So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back upagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touchedone of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come intomy eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to setstill. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; butit seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven differentplaces now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begunto breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty sooncomfortable again.Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and wewent creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tomwhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I saidno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out Iwarn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slipin the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jimmight wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in thereand got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would doTom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and playsomething on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything wasso still and lonesome.As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side ofthe house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung iton a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim toldit he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, everytime he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said theyrode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his backwas all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and hegot so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would comemiles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than anynigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouthsopen and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers isalways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; butwhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?” andthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always keptthat five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was acharm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he couldcure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just bysaying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything theyhad, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touchit, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined fora servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the deviland been rode by witches.Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away downinto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, wherethere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling everso fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, andawful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper andBen Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep thesecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickestpart of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on ourhands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the caveopened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon duckedunder a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  Wewent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp andsweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:“Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his namein blood.”Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he hadwrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to theband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything toany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person andhis family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till hehad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the signof the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use thatmark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must bekilled.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, hemust have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and theashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list withblood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on itand be forgot forever.Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he gotit out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out ofpirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned hadit.Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that toldthe secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wroteit in. Then Ben Rogers says:“Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bouthim?”“Well, hain't he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.“Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  Heused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seenin these parts for a year or more.”They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because theysaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else itwouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think ofanything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most readyto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them MissWatson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:“Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.”Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,and I made my mark on the paper.“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what's the line of business of this Gang?”“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,” says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain't burglars.  That ain't no sort of style.  Weare highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with maskson, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”“Must we always kill the people?”“Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, butmostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring tothe cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.”“Ransomed?  What's that?”“I don't know.  But that's what they do.  I've seen it in books; and soof course that's what we've got to do.”“But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?”“Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it.  Don't I tell you it's in thebooks?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,and get things all muddled up?”“Oh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nationare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do itto them?--that's the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon itis?”“Well, I don't know.  But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,it means that we keep them till they're dead.”“Now, that's something _like_.  That'll answer.  Why couldn't you saidthat before?  We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and abothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always tryingto get loose.”“How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there's a guardover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”“A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody's got to set up all nightand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that'sfoolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon asthey get here?”“Because it ain't in the books so--that's why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do youwant to do things regular, or don't you?--that's the idea.  Don't youreckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correctthing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything?  Not by a gooddeal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”“All right.  I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow.  Say, dowe kill the women, too?”“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on.  Killthe women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  Youfetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home anymore.”“Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellowswaiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers.But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say.”Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he wasscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn'twant to be a robber any more.So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made himmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  ButTom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home andmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wantedto begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do iton Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They agreed to get together andfix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer firstcaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day wasbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I wasdog-tired."

    "text": "WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson onaccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleanedoff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I wouldbehave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closetand prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, andwhatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn't so.  I tried it.Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn't any good to me withouthooks.  I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow Icouldn't make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson totry for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why, and Icouldn't make it out no way.I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don'tDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?  Why can't the widow getback her silver snuffbox that was stole?  Why can't Miss Watson fat up?No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it.  I went and told thewidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying forit was “spiritual gifts.”  This was too many for me, but she told mewhat she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could forother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think aboutmyself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in thewoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see noadvantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckonedI wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes thewidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to makea body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take holdand knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was twoProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with thewidow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no helpfor him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belongto the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he wasa-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I wasso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortablefor me; I didn't want to see him no more.  He used to always whale mewhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to taketo the woods most of the time when he was around.  Well, about this timehe was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, sopeople said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man wasjust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was alllike pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it hadbeen in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all.  They saidhe was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried himon the bank.  But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to thinkof something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float onhis back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, buta woman dressed up in a man's clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished hewouldn't.We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  Allthe boys did.  We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, butonly just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go chargingdown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,but we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,” and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to thecave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killedand marked.  But I couldn't see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent aboy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said hehad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanishmerchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with twohundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guardof four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he calledit, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we must slick upour swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even aturnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at themtill you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes morethan what they was before.  I didn't believe we could lick such a crowdof Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we gotthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn'tno Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-classat that.  We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but wenever got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers gota rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then theteacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there wasloads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,and elephants and things.  I said, why couldn't we see them, then?  Hesaid if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, Iwould know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  Hesaid there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they hadturned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for themagicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.“Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of genies, and theywould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.  Theyare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”“Well,” I says, “s'pose we got some genies to help _us_--can't we lickthe other crowd then?”“How you going to get them?”“I don't know.  How do _they_ get them?”“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the geniescome tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and thesmoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it. They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, andbelting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or anyother man.”“Who makes them tear around so?”“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to whoever rubsthe lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says.  If hetells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fillit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor'sdaughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it--and they'vegot to do it before sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they've gotto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, youunderstand.”“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keepingthe palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that.  And what'smore--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I woulddrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”“How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it,whether you wanted to or not.”“What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All right, then;I _would_ come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree therewas in the country.”“Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don't seem toknow anything, somehow--perfect saphead.”I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned Iwould see if there was anything in it.  I got an old tin lamp and aniron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweatlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn'tno use, none of the genies come.  So then I judged that all that stuffwas only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies.  I reckoned he believed in theA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had allthe marks of a Sunday-school."

    "text": "WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winternow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read andwrite just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to sixtimes seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get anyfurther than that if I was to live forever.  I don't take no stock inmathematics, anyway.At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got nextday done me good and cheered me up.  So the longer I went to school theeasier it got to be.  I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways,too, and they warn't so raspy on me.  Living in a house and sleeping ina bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather Iused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was arest to me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked thenew ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow butsure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn't ashamed of me.One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my leftshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,and crossed me off. She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; whata mess you are always making!”  The widow put in a good word for me, butthat warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, andwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't oneof them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked alonglow-spirited and on the watch-out.I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you gothrough the high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on theground, and I seen somebody's tracks.  They had come up from the quarryand stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the gardenfence.  It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so.  Icouldn't make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going tofollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn'tnotice anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the leftboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked over myshoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody.  I was at JudgeThatcher's as quick as I could get there.  He said:“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for yourinterest?”“No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fiftydollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let me invest italong with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it.”“No, sir,” I says, “I don't want to spend it.  I don't want it atall--nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take it; I want to giveit to you--the six thousand and all.”He looked surprised.  He couldn't seem to make it out.  He says:“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”I says, “Don't you ask me no questions about it, please.  You'll takeit--won't you?”He says:“Well, I'm puzzled.  Is something the matter?”“Please take it,” says I, “and don't ask me nothing--then I won't have totell no lies.”He studied a while, and then he says:“Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to _sell_ all your property to me--notgive it.  That's the correct idea.”Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:“There; you see it says 'for a consideration.'  That means I have boughtit of you and paid you for it.  Here's a dollar for you.  Now you signit.”So I signed it, and left.Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, whichhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to domagic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowedeverything.  So I went to him that night and told him pap was hereagain, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted to know was,what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out hishair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and droppedit on the floor.  It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes itwouldn't talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeitquarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silvera little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show,because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on itevery time.  (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I gotfrom the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ballwould take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smeltit and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ballwould think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potatoand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and nextmorning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more,and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listenedagain. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.  He said itwould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I says, go on.  So thehair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.  He says:“Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do.  Sometimes hespec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay.  De bes' way is tores' easy en let de ole man take his own way.  Dey's two angels hoverin'roun' 'bout him.  One uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black.De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sailin en bust it all up.  A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetchhim at de las'.  But you is all right.  You gwyne to have considabletrouble in yo' life, en considable joy.  Sometimes you gwyne to githurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyneto git well agin.  Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life.  Oneuv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'. You's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by.  Youwants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run noresk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung.”When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap hisown self!"

    "text": "I had shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he was.  I usedto be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  I reckoned Iwas scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, afterthe first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he beingso unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worthbothring about.He was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and tangled andgreasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining throughlike he was behind vines.  It was all black, no gray; so was his long,mixed-up whiskers.  There warn't no color in his face, where his faceshowed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to makea body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, afish-belly white.  As for his clothes--just rags, that was all.  He hadone ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, andtwo of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.  His hatwas laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, likea lid.I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chairtilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I noticed the window wasup; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He kept a-looking me all over.  Byand by he says:“Starchy clothes--very.  You think you're a good deal of a big-bug,_don't_ you?”“Maybe I am, maybe I ain't,” I says.“Don't you give me none o' your lip,” says he.  “You've put onconsiderable many frills since I been away.  I'll take you down a pegbefore I get done with you.  You're educated, too, they say--can read andwrite.  You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, becausehe can't?  _I'll_ take it out of you.  Who told you you might meddlewith such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?”“The widow.  She told me.”“The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovelabout a thing that ain't none of her business?”“Nobody never told her.”“Well, I'll learn her how to meddle.  And looky here--you drop thatschool, you hear?  I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airsover his own father and let on to be better'n what _he_ is.  You lemmecatch you fooling around that school again, you hear?  Your mothercouldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died.  Noneof the family couldn't before _they_ died.  I can't; and here you'rea-swelling yourself up like this.  I ain't the man to stand it--you hear?Say, lemme hear you read.”I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and thewars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whackwith his hand and knocked it across the house.  He says:“It's so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now lookyhere; you stop that putting on frills.  I won't have it.  I'll lay foryou, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tan you good.First you know you'll get religion, too.  I never see such a son.”He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, andsays:“What's this?”“It's something they give me for learning my lessons good.”He tore it up, and says:“I'll give you something better--I'll give you a cowhide.”He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:“_Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; anda look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own fathergot to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.  I never see such a son.  Ibet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you.Why, there ain't no end to your airs--they say you're rich.  Hey?--how'sthat?”“They lie--that's how.”“Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I canstand now--so don't gimme no sass.  I've been in town two days, and Ihain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich.  I heard about itaway down the river, too.  That's why I come.  You git me that moneyto-morrow--I want it.”“I hain't got no money.”“It's a lie.  Judge Thatcher's got it.  You git it.  I want it.”“I hain't got no money, I tell you.  You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll tellyou the same.”“All right.  I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll knowthe reason why.  Say, how much you got in your pocket?  I want it.”“I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to--”“It don't make no difference what you want it for--you just shell itout.”He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he wasgoing down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day.When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussedme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when Ireckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told meto mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lickme if I didn't drop that.Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyraggedhim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and thenhe swore he'd make the law force him.The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me awayfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge thathad just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn'tinterfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druthernot take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widowhad to quit on the business.That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest.  He said he'd cowhideme till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him.  Iborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and gotdrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carryingon; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailedhim again for a week.  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was bossof his son, and he'd make it warm for _him_.When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, andhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was justold pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him abouttemperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd beena fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn overa new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped thejudge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he couldhug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; papsaid he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and thejudge said he believed it.  The old man said that what a man wantedthat was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they criedagain.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out hishand, and says:“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it'sthe hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die beforehe'll go back.  You mark them words--don't forget I said them.  It's aclean hand now; shake it--don't be afeard.”So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  Thejudge's wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--madehis mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or somethinglike that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which wasthe spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty andclumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded hisnew coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good oldtime; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, androlled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was mostfroze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they cometo look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they couldnavigate it.The judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reformthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way."

    "text": "WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he wentfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and hewent for me, too, for not stopping school.  He catched me a couple oftimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodgedhim or outrun him most of the time.  I didn't want to go to school muchbefore, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap.  That law trial was aslow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it;so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judgefor him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money hegot drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; andevery time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kindof thing was right in his line.He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him atlast that if he didn't quit using around there she would make troublefor him. Well, _wasn't_ he mad?  He said he would show who was HuckFinn's boss.  So he watched out for me one day in the spring, andcatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, andcrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn'tno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thickyou couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put thekey under his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every littlewhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to theferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and gotdrunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out whereI was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; butpap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I wasused to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smokingand fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, andmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd evergot to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat ona plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be foreverbothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all thetime.  I didn't want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, becausethe widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn'tno objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take itall around.But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't standit. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, andlocking me in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It wasdreadful lonesome.  I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't evergoing to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fixup some way to leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin manya time, but I couldn't find no way.  There warn't a window to it bigenough for a dog to get through.  I couldn't get up the chimbly; itwas too narrow.  The door was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was prettycareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, Iwas most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put inthe time.  But this time I found something at last; I found an old rustywood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and theclapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.  There was anold horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabinbehind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks andputting the candle out.  I got under the table and raised the blanket,and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enoughto let me through.  Well, it was a good long job, but I was gettingtowards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods.  I got rid ofthe signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and prettysoon pap come in.Pap warn't in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he wasdown town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckonedhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started onthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and JudgeThatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd beanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for myguardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me upconsiderable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any moreand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old mangot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any,and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the namesof, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and wentright along with his cussing.He said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watchout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a placesix or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till theydropped and they couldn't find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again,but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he gotthat chance.The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he hadgot. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and twonewspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and wentback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it allover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, andtake to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn't stay in oneplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, andhunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man northe widow couldn't ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out andleave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  Igot so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the oldman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  WhileI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort ofwarmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A bodywould a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquorbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like.Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him--aman's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxietyand all the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got thatson raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call_that_ govment!  That ain't all, nuther.  The law backs that old JudgeThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property.  Here's whatthe law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars andup'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and letshim go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call thatgovment!  A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. SometimesI've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,and I _told_ 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of 'emheard me, and can tell what I said.  Says I, for two cents I'd leave theblamed country and never come a-near it agin.  Them's the very words.  Isays look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and therest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightlya hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o'stove-pipe.  Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of thewealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white asa white man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and theshiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fineclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and asilver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  Andwhat do you think?  They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and couldtalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain't thewust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.  Well, that let meout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was 'lection day,and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to getthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country wherethey'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country mayrot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see thecool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn'tshoved him out o' the way.  I says to the people, why ain't this niggerput up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know.  And what do youreckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been inthe State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet.  There,now--that's a specimen.  They call that a govment that can't sell a freenigger till he's been in the State six months.  Here's a govment thatcalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is agovment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months beforeit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted freenigger, and--”Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs wastaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork andbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kindof language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he givethe tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around thecabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holdingfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with hisleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But itwarn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of histoes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl thatfairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, androlled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid overanything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laidover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky therefor two drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  Ijudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would stealthe key, or saw myself out, one or t'other.  He drank and drank, andtumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned andthrashed around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got sosleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before Iknowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was anawful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skippingaround every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they wascrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and sayone had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes.  He startedand run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take himoff! he's biting me on the neck!”  I never see a man look so wild in theeyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then herolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming andsaying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laidstill a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and itseemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by heraised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,very low:“Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're comingafter me; but I won't go.  Oh, they're here! don't touch me--don't! handsoff--they're cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!”Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let himalone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under theold pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I couldhear him through the blanket.By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and hesee me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with aclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,and then I couldn't come for him no more.  I begged, and told him Iwas only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared andcussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short anddodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between myshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quickas lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, anddropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest aminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he wouldsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.So he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chairand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down thegun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then Ilaid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set downbehind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time diddrag along."

That man warn't here for no good.  I'd a shot him.  Next time youroust me out, you hear?”Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had beensaying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix itnow so nobody won't think of following me.About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  Theriver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on therise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catchmore stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for onetime; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in andtook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three. I judged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned hehad got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on thatlog again.  Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of thehole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, andshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the samewith the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee andsugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took thebucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and twoblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines andmatches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleanedout the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one outat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetchedout the gun, and now I was done.I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and draggingout so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outsideby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and thesawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put tworocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent upat that place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or fivefoot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never noticeit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likelyanybody would go fooling around there.It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  Ifollowed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over theriver.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soonwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairiefarms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked itconsiderable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearlyto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him downon the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocksin it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it tothe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, anddown it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had beendragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed hewould take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancytouches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing asthat.Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, andstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then Itook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn'tdrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him intothe river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bagof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in thebottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on theplace--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  ThenI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and throughthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wideand full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  Therewas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that wentmiles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The mealsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I droppedpap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done byaccident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so itwouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under somewillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  Imade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laiddown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and thendrag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lakeand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbersthat killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river foranything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won'tbother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's theplace.I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  WhenI woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and lookedaround, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles andmiles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logsthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out fromshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and startwhen I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon Imade it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes fromoars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out throughthe willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it wasabreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybeit's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with thecurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid hisoars.I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down streamsoft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle ofthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, andpeople might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, andthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, lookingaway into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep whenyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard peopletalking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every wordof it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the shortnights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, hereckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and theylaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, andlaughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and saidlet him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to hisold woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn'tnothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say itwas nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more thanabout a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson'sIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered andstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, likea steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar atthe head--it was all under water now.It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a rippingrate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water andlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe intoa deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willowbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoefrom the outside.I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and lookedout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  Amonstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Sternoars, there! heave her head to stabboard!”  I heard that just as plainas if the man was by my side.There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, andlaid down for a nap before breakfast."

    "text": "THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eighto'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking aboutthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  Icould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big treesall about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled placeson the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and thefreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a littlebreeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at mevery friendly.I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cookbreakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deepsound of “boom!” away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbowand listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went andlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke layingon the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was theferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was thematter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat'sside.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make mycarcass come to the top.I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched thecannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a goodenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite toeat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver inloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to thedrownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, andif any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  Ichanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I couldhave, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and Imost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated outfurther.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to theshore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dabof quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was “baker's bread”--what thequality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munchingthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  Andthen something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parsonor somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has goneand done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in thatthing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or theparson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work foronly just the right kind.I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  Theferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chanceto see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come inclose, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along downtowards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Wherethe log forked I could peep through.By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they coulda run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and TomSawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in andsays:“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he'swashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  Ihope so, anyway.”I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearlyin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could seethem first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me thatit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, andI judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'da got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks togoodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulderof the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further andfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more. The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, andwas giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned aroundthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed overto that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of theisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore andwent home to the town.I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting afterme. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thickwoods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my thingsunder so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggledhim open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and hadsupper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty wellsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and seton the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted thestars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; youcan't stay so, you soon get over it.And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I wasboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to knowall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plentystrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and greenrazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  Theywould all come handy by and by, I judged.Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn'tfar from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shotnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nighhome. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I afterit, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden Ibounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to lookfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes asfast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst thethick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hearnothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trodon a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of mybreaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sandin my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So Igot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like anold last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as athousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last Igot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all thetime. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over frombreakfast.By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was goodand dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to theIllinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods andcooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay thereall night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and saysto myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I goteverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creepingthrough the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when Ihear a man say:“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is aboutbeat out.  Let's look around.”I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in theold place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every timeI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn'tdo me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'ma-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'llfind it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, andthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon wasshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and soundasleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  Alittle ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as sayingthe night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brungher nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edgeof the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through theleaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanketthe river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towardswhere I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or twoto listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find theplace.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire awaythrough the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I wasclose enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  Itmost give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and hishead was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, inabout six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was gettinggray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hoveoff the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to seehim.  I says:“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,and puts his hands together and says:“Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuzliked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in deriver agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uzawluz yo' fren'.”Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever soglad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only setthere and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:“It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.”“What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sichtruck? But you got a gun, hain't you?  Den we kin git sumfn better denstrawbries.”“Strawberries and such truck,” I says.  “Is that what you live on?”“I couldn' git nuffn else,” he says.“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”“I come heah de night arter you's killed.”“What, all that time?”“Yes--indeedy.”“And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”“No, sah--nuffn else.”“Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?”“I reck'n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on deislan'?”“Since the night I got killed.”“No!  W'y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you gota gun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.”So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire ina grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon andcoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and thenigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all donewith witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned himwith his knife, and fried him.When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Thenwhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and byJim says:“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef itwarn't you?”Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said TomSawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?”He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute.  Then hesays:“Maybe I better not tell.”“Why, Jim?”“Well, dey's reasons.  But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you,would you, Huck?”“Blamed if I would, Jim.”“Well, I b'lieve you, Huck.  I--_I run off_.”“Jim!”“But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell,Huck.”“Well, I did.  I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it.  Honest _injun_,I will.  People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me forkeeping mum--but that don't make no difference.  I ain't a-going to tell,and I ain't a-going back there, anyways.  So, now, le's know all aboutit.”“Well, you see, it 'uz dis way.  Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she peckson me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said shewouldn' sell me down to Orleans.  But I noticed dey wuz a nigger traderroun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.  Well, onenight I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en Ihear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, butshe didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'.  De widder she try togit her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.  Ilit out mighty quick, I tell you.“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long desho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hidin de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody togo 'way. Well, I wuz dah all night.  Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time. 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight ernine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come overto de town en say you's killed.  Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies engenlmen a-goin' over for to see de place.  Sometimes dey'd pull up atde sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got toknow all 'bout de killin'.  I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, butI ain't no mo' now.“I laid dah under de shavin's all day.  I 'uz hungry, but I warn'tafeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start tode camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knowsI goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see meroun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'.De yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holidaysoon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout twomile er more to whah dey warn't no houses.  I'd made up my mine 'boutwhat I's agwyne to do.  You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot,de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss datskift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, enwhah to pick up my track.  So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan'_make_ no track.“I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove'a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin decurrent tell de raff come along.  Den I swum to de stern uv it en tucka-holt.  It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while.  So I clumbup en laid down on de planks.  De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle,whah de lantern wuz.  De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current;so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down deriver, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho', en take tode woods on de Illinois side.“But I didn' have no luck.  When we 'uz mos' down to de head er deislan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no usefer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'.  Well, Ihad a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too bluff. I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good place.  I wentinto de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as deymove de lantern roun' so.  I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en somematches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right.”“And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?  Whydidn't you get mud-turkles?”“How you gwyne to git 'm?  You can't slip up on um en grab um; en how'sa body gwyne to hit um wid a rock?  How could a body do it in de night? En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.”“Well, that's so.  You've had to keep in the woods all the time, ofcourse. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?”“Oh, yes.  I knowed dey was arter you.  I see um go by heah--watched umthoo de bushes.”Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time andlighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  He said it wasa sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was thesame way when young birds done it.  I was going to catch some of them,but Jim wouldn't let me.  He said it was death.  He said his father laidmighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old grannysaid his father would die, and he did.And Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook fordinner, because that would bring bad luck.  The same if you shook thetable-cloth after sundown.  And he said if a man owned a beehiveand that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up nextmorning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, becauseI had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  Jimknowed all kinds of signs.  He said he knowed most everything.  I saidit looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I askedhim if there warn't any good-luck signs.  He says:“Mighty few--an' _dey_ ain't no use to a body.  What you want to knowwhen good luck's a-comin' for?  Want to keep it off?”  And he said:  “Efyou's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you's agwyneto be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so furahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so youmight git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign datyou gwyne to be rich bymeby.”“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”“What's de use to ax dat question?  Don't you see I has?”“Well, are you rich?”“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.  Wunst I hadfoteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out.”“What did you speculate in, Jim?”“Well, fust I tackled stock.”“What kind of stock?”“Why, live stock--cattle, you know.  I put ten dollars in a cow.  ButI ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock.  De cow up 'n' died on myhan's.”“So you lost the ten dollars.”“No, I didn't lose it all.  I on'y los' 'bout nine of it.  I sole dehide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”“You had five dollars and ten cents left.  Did you speculate any more?”“Yes.  You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old MistoBradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollarwould git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year.  Well, all de niggerswent in, but dey didn't have much.  I wuz de on'y one dat had much.  SoI stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'dstart a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out erde business, bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, sohe say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en'er de year.“So I done it.  Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars rightoff en keep things a-movin'.  Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat hadketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'nhim en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er deyear come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day deone-laigged nigger say de bank's busted.  So dey didn' none uv us git nomoney.”“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”“Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole meto give it to a nigger name' Balum--Balum's Ass dey call him for short;he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know.  But he's lucky, dey say, en Isee I warn't lucky.  De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'dmake a raise for me.  Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz inchurch he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to deLord, en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times.  So Balum he tucken give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne tocome of it.”“Well, what did come of it, Jim?”“Nuffn never come of it.  I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way;en Balum he couldn'.  I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see desecurity.  Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says!Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er dechanst.”“Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich againsome time or other.”“Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it.  I owns mysef, en I's wutheight hund'd dollars.  I wisht I had de money, I wouldn' want no mo'.”"

    "text": "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the islandthat I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a milewide.This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foothigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep andthe bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and byand by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on theside towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three roomsbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool inthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said wedidn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the trapsin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said themlittle birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things toget wet?So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close byto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish offof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on oneside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and agood place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Prettysoon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds wasright about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regularsummer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-blackoutside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick thatthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here wouldcome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up thepale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust wouldfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if theywas just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest andblackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a littleglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin againin a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards theunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--whereit's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.“Jim, this is nice,” I says.  “I wouldn't want to be nowhere else buthere. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”“Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim.  You'd a bendown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too;dat you would, honey.  Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so dode birds, chile.”The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till atlast it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep onthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that sideit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the sameold distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just awall of high bluffs.Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cooland shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  Wewent winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hungso thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every oldbroken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; andwhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, onaccount of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put yourhand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they wouldslide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, andthe top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  Wecould see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;we didn't show ourselves in daylight.Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just beforedaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She wasa two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and gotaboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Thenwe looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, andtwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and therewas clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on thefloor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:“Hello, you!”But it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:“De man ain't asleep--he's dead.  You hold still--I'll go en see.”He went, and bent down and looked, and says:“It's a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He's ben shot in de back.I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan' lookat his face--it's too gashly.”I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, buthe needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of oldgreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the wallswas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and somewomen's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was aboy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And therewas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for ababy to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There wasa seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  Theystood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in ahurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, anda bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallowcandles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a rattyold bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins andbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchetand some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with somemonstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no labelon them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The strapswas broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, thoughit was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't findthe other one, though we hunted all around.And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready toshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was prettybroad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with thequilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a goodways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down mosta half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, andhadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody.  We got home all safe."

    "text": "AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how hecome to be killed, but Jim didn't want to.  He said it would fetch badluck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a manthat warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than onethat was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, soI didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it andwishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silversewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckonedthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed themoney was there they wouldn't a left it.  I said I reckoned they killedhim, too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that.  I says:“Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in thesnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skinwith my hands.  Well, here's your bad luck!  We've raked in all thistruck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad lucklike this every day, Jim.”“Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don't you git too peart.  It'sa-comin'.  Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'.”It did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, afterdinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of theridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, andfound a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on thefoot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some funwhen Jim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a lightthe snake's mate was there, and bit him.He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was thevarmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in asecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pourit down.He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That allcomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leavea dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim toldme to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin thebody and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said itwould help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them aroundhis wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quietand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't goingto let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of hishead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself hewent to sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, andso did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judgedhe was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap'swhisky.Jim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was allgone and he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn't ever takea-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had comeof it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he saidthat handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn'tgot to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over hisleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skinin his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I'vealways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder isone of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old HankBunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years hegot drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out sothat he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid himedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, sothey say, but I didn't see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come oflooking at the moon that way, like a fool.Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banksagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the bighooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that wasas big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over twohundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung usinto Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear aroundtill he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a roundball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, tocoat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was evercatched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seena bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-housethere; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makesa good fry.Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get astirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river andfind out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said Imust go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calicogowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jimhitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on thesun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look inand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim saidnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced aroundall day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do prettywell in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he saidI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I tooknotice, and done better.I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, andthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  Itied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in alittle shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wonderedwho had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at thewindow.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting bya candle that was on a pine table.  I didn't know her face; she was astranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I hadcome; people might know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman hadbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted toknow; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget Iwas a girl."

    "text": "“COME in,” says the woman, and I did.  She says:  “Take a cheer.”I done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:“What might your name be?”“Sarah Williams.”“Where 'bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?'“No'm.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I've walked all the way andI'm all tired out.”“Hungry, too, I reckon.  I'll find you something.”“No'm, I ain't hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles belowhere at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more.  It's what makes me so late.My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come totell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the town, shesays.  I hain't ever been here before.  Do you know him?”“No; but I don't know everybody yet.  I haven't lived here quite twoweeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.  Youbetter stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet.”“No,” I says; “I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain't afearedof the dark.”She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be inby and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me.Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations upthe river, and her relations down the river, and about how much betteroff they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistakecoming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out whatwas going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and themurder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (onlyshe got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and whata hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.  Isays:“Who done it?  We've heard considerable about these goings on down inHookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn.”“Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people _here_ that'dlike to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it himself.”“No--is that so?”“Most everybody thought it at first.  He'll never know how nigh he cometo getting lynched.  But before night they changed around and judged itwas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”“Why _he_--”I stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and nevernoticed I had put in at all:“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there's areward out for him--three hundred dollars.  And there's a reward out forold Finn, too--two hundred dollars.  You see, he come to town themorning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on theferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before night theywanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day theyfound out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen senceten o'clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on him,you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for thenigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that eveninghe got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mightyhard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain'tcome back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thingblows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy andfixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd getHuck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn't any too good to do it.  Oh, he's sly, I reckon. If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right.  You can't proveanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, andhe'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing.”“Yes, I reckon so, 'm.  I don't see nothing in the way of it.  Haseverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”“Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But they'll getthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.”“Why, are they after him yet?”“Well, you're innocent, ain't you!  Does three hundred dollars layaround every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the niggerain't far from here.  I'm one of them--but I hain't talked it around.  Afew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door inthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes tothat island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island.  Don't anybodylive there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn't say any more, butI done some thinking.  I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke overthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I saysto myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, saysI, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain't seen anysmoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband'sgoing over to see--him and another man.  He was gone up the river; but hegot back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.”I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still.  I had to do something with myhands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threadingit. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.  When the womanstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curiousand smiling a little.  I put down the needle and thread, and let on tobe interested--and I was, too--and says:“Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother could getit. Is your husband going over there to-night?”“Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get aboat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They'll go over aftermidnight.”“Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”“Yes.  And couldn't the nigger see better, too?  After midnight he'lllikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt uphis camp fire all the better for the dark, if he's got one.”“I didn't think of that.”The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bitcomfortable.  Pretty soon she says,“What did you say your name was, honey?”“M--Mary Williams.”Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn'tlook up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman wouldsay something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  Butnow she says:“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”“Oh, yes'm, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah's my first name.  Somecalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”“Oh, that's the way of it?”“Yes'm.”I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.  Icouldn't look up yet.Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poorthey had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned theplace, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was rightabout the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the cornerevery little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw atthem when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showedme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shotwith it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn'tknow whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of courseI didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed hisnose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been atolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned Iwould hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetchedit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to helpher with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, andwent on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she broke offto say:“Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,handy.”So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clappedmy legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about aminute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,and very pleasant, and says:“Come, now, what's your real name?”“Wh--what, mum?”“What's your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?”I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do.  ButI says:“Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I'm in theway here, I'll--”“No, you won't.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain't going to hurtyou, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me yoursecret, and trust me.  I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll helpyou. So'll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you're a runaway'prentice, that's all.  It ain't anything.  There ain't no harm in it.You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,child, I wouldn't tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that's a goodboy.”So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and Iwould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn'tgo back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirtymile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand itno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took mychance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, andI had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried fromhome lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed myuncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struckout for this town of Goshen.“Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen'sten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?”“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turninto the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked Imust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”“He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.”“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now.  I gotto be moving along.  I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.”“Hold on a minute.  I'll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.”So she put me up a snack, and says:“Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answerup prompt now--don't stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?”“The hind end, mum.”“Well, then, a horse?”“The for'rard end, mum.”“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”“North side.”“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats withtheir heads pointed the same direction?”“The whole fifteen, mum.”“Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe youwas trying to hocus me again.  What's your real name, now?”“George Peters, mum.”“Well, try to remember it, George.  Don't forget and tell me it'sElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's GeorgeElexander when I catch you.  And don't go about women in that oldcalico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold thethread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still andpoke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but aman always does t'other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head asawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throwstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it toturn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm outto one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catchanything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap themtogether, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, Ispotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrivedthe other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into troubleyou send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I canto get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next timeyou tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one,and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.”I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracksand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  Ijumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough tomake the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off thesun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then.  When I was about themiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; thesound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck thehead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, butI shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and starteda good fire there on a high and dry spot.Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a halfbelow, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timberand up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep onthe ground.  I roused him out and says:“Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain't a minute to lose.  They'reafter us!”Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way heworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  Bythat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she wasready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  Weput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show acandle outside after that.I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadowsain't good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along downin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying aword."

    "text": "IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island atlast, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to comealong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinoisshore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought toput the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  Wewas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn'tgood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire Ibuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayedaway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't nofault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in abig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches withthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like therehad been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that hascottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinoisside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so wewarn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, andup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim allabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she wasa smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't setdown and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, Isaid, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said hebet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and hebelieved they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all thattime, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen milebelow the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as longas they didn't.When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of thecottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snugwigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the thingsdry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more abovethe level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out ofreach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made alayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it forto hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weatheror chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extrasteering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snagor something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lanternon, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboatcoming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't haveto light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they calla “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks beingstill a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run thechannel, but hunted easy water.This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a currentthat was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind ofsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs lookingup at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and itwarn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  Wehad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened tous at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  Thefifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousandpeople in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderfulspread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a soundthere; everybody was asleep.Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some littlevillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or otherstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roostingcomfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken whenyou get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easyfind somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never seepap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used tosay, anyway.Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed awatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things ofthat kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if youwas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn'tanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partlyright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three thingsfrom the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckonedit wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over allone night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our mindswhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, andconcluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling justright before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the wayit come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmonswouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morningor didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, welived pretty high.The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, witha power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solidsheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her verydistinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck abovewater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and achair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,when the flashes come.Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wrecklaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  Iwanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see whatthere was there.  So I says:“Le's land on her, Jim.”But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:“I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well,en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.  Like as notdey's a watchman on dat wrack.”“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain't nothing to watch butthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to reskhis life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, whenit's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”  Jimcouldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  “And besides,” I says,“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom. Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboatcaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don'tcare a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick acandle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, hewouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'dland on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw styleinto it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think itwas Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer_was_ here.”Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any morethan we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed usthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, andmade fast there.The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it tolabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with ourfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was sodark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forwardend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us infront of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away downthrough the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second weseem to hear low voices in yonder!Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to comealong.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but justthen I heard a voice wail out and say:“Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!”Another voice said, pretty loud:“It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always wantmore'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, becauseyou've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've saidit jest one time too many.  You're the meanest, treacherousest hound inthis country.”By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling withcuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So Idropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aftin the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and thecross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on thefloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and oneof them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, andsaying:“I'd _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don't, Bill;I hain't ever goin' to tell.”And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh andsay:“'Deed you _ain't!_  You never said no truer thing 'n that, you betyou.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got thebest of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jistfor noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for.  ButI lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put_up_ that pistol, Bill.”Bill says:“I don't want to, Jake Packard.  I'm for killin' him--and didn't he killold Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he deserve it?”“But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.”“Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit youlong's I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nailand started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Billto come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boatslanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from gettingrun over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to mystateroom, he says:“Here--come in here.”And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was upin the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't seethem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much differenceanyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because Ididn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wantedto kill Turner.  He says:“He's said he'll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our sharesto him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the waywe've served him.  Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; nowyou hear _me_.  I'm for putting him out of his troubles.”“So'm I,” says Packard, very quiet.“Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.  Well, then, that's allright.  Le's go and do it.”“Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.  You listen to me.Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to bedone. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go court'n aroundafter a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that'sjist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks.  Ain'tthat so?”“You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this time?”“Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up whateverpickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hidethe truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n twohours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his ownself.  I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him. I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; itain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?”“Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?”“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?”“All right, then; come along.”So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambledforward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarsewhisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of amoan, and I says:“Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's agang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and sether drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from thewreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find theirboat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.Quick--hurry!  I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. Youstart at the raft, and--”“Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf'_?  Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done brokeloose en gone I--en here we is!”"

    "text": "WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck withsuch a gang as that!  But it warn't no time to be sentimentering.  We'd_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we wenta-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jimsaid he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn'thardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get lefton this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struckfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled alongforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for theedge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to thecross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barelysee her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a beenaboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck hishead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;but he jerked it in again, and says:“Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!”He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself andset down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packardsays, in a low voice:“All ready--shove off!”I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Billsays:“Hold on--'d you go through him?”“No.  Didn't you?”“No.  So he's got his share o' the cash yet.”“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”“Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?”“Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”So they got out and went in.The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a halfsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with myknife and cut the rope, and away we went!We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly evenbreathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of thepaddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was ahundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, everylast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lanternshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowedby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning tounderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was thefirst time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn'thad time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even formurderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain't notelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how wouldI like it?  So says I to Jim:“The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or aboveit, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, andthen I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go forthat gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung whentheir time comes.”But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a lightshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time therain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and wemade for it.It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  Weseen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I wouldgo for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stolethere on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I toldJim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had goneabout two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oarsand shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four moreshowed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shorelight, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was alantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmedaround for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by andby I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down betweenhis knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun tocry.He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was onlyme he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:“Hello, what's up?  Don't cry, bub.  What's the trouble?”I says:“Pap, and mam, and sis, and--”Then I broke down.  He says:“Oh, dang it now, _don't_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,and this 'n 'll come out all right.  What's the matter with 'em?”“They're--they're--are you the watchman of the boat?”“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  “I'm the captainand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and headdeck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers.  I ain't asrich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and goodto Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way hedoes; but I've told him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places withhim; for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if_I'd_ live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin'on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I--”I broke in and says:“They're in an awful peck of trouble, and--”“_Who_ is?”“Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take yourferryboat and go up there--”“Up where?  Where are they?”“On the wreck.”“What wreck?”“Why, there ain't but one.”“What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?”“Yes.”“Good land! what are they doin' _there_, for gracious sakes?”“Well, they didn't go there a-purpose.”“I bet they didn't!  Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'emif they don't git off mighty quick!  Why, how in the nation did theyever git into such a scrape?”“Easy enough.  Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--”“Yes, Booth's Landing--go on.”“She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge ofthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferryto stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her Idisremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swungaround and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, andsaddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman andthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboardthe wreck.  Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in ourtrading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we wasright on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved butBill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish 't it hadbeen me, I do.”“My George!  It's the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And _then_ whatdid you all do?”“Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn'tmake nobody hear.  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get helpsomehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here andhunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing.  I made the land about a milebelow, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to dosomething, but they said, 'What, in such a night and such a current?There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.'  Now if you'll goand--”“By Jackson, I'd _like_ to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; butwho in the dingnation's a-going' to _pay_ for it?  Do you reckon yourpap--”“Why _that's_ all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, thather uncle Hornback--”“Great guns! is _he_ her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that lightover yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about aquarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart youout to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill.  And don't you foolaround any, because he'll want to know the news.  Tell him I'll havehis niece all safe before he can get to town.  Hump yourself, now; I'ma-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.”I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went backand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore inthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in amongsome woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboatstart. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable onaccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many woulda done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would beproud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions anddead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interestin.Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding alongdown! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out forher.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chancefor anybody being alive in her.  I pulled all around her and hollereda little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still.  I felt a littlebit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if theycould stand it I could.Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the riveron a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reachI laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around thewreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know heruncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat giveit up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-boomingdown the river.It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and whenit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  By the time Igot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so westruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turnedin and slept like dead people."

    "text": "BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stoleoff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and allsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and threeboxes of seegars.  We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither ofour lives.  The seegars was prime.  We laid off all the afternoon in thewoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general goodtime. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at theferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he saidhe didn't want no more adventures.  He said that when I went in thetexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone henearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it couldbe fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if hedid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to getthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.  Well, hewas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for anigger.I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, andhow gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called eachother your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'steadof mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested.  He says:“I didn' know dey was so many un um.  I hain't hearn 'bout none un um,skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in apack er k'yards.  How much do a king git?”“Get?”  I says; “why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they wantit; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs tothem.”“_Ain'_ dat gay?  En what dey got to do, Huck?”“_They_ don't do nothing!  Why, how you talk! They just set around.”“No; is dat so?”“Of course it is.  They just set around--except, maybe, when there's awar; then they go to the war.  But other times they just lazy around; orgo hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d' you hear a noise?”We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of asteamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.“Yes,” says I, “and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with theparlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off.But mostly they hang round the harem.”“Roun' de which?”“Harem.”“What's de harem?”“The place where he keeps his wives.  Don't you know about the harem?Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.”“Why, yes, dat's so; I--I'd done forgot it.  A harem's a bo'd'n-house, Ireck'n.  Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery.  En I reck'nde wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket.  Yit dey saySollermun de wises' man dat ever live'.  I doan' take no stock indat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich ablim-blammin' all de time?  No--'deed he wouldn't.  A wise man 'ud takeen buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factrywhen he want to res'.”“Well, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she toldme so, her own self.”“I doan k'yer what de widder say, he _warn't_ no wise man nuther.  Hehad some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see.  Does you know 'bout datchile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?”“Yes, the widow told me all about it.”“_Well_, den!  Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'?  You jes'take en look at it a minute.  Dah's de stump, dah--dat's one er de women;heah's you--dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill'sde chile.  Bofe un you claims it.  What does I do?  Does I shin aroun'mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b'long to, enhan' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dathad any gumption would?  No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en givehalf un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman.  Dat's de waySollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile.  Now I want to ast you:  what'sde use er dat half a bill?--can't buy noth'n wid it.  En what use is ahalf a chile?  I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um.”“But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point--blame it, you've missedit a thousand mile.”“Who?  Me?  Go 'long.  Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints.  I reck'n Iknows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's asdat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a wholechile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chilewid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain.  Doan'talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.”“But I tell you you don't get the point.”“Blame de point!  I reck'n I knows what I knows.  En mine you, de _real_pint is down furder--it's down deeper.  It lays in de way Sollermun wasraised.  You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat mangwyne to be waseful o' chillen?  No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it.  _He_know how to value 'em.  But you take a man dat's got 'bout five millionchillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt.  _He_ as soon chop achile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'.  A chile er two, mo' er less,warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!”I never see such a nigger.  If he got a notion in his head once, therewarn't no getting it out again.  He was the most down on Solomon ofany nigger I ever see.  So I went to talking about other kings, and letSolomon slide.  I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut offin France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, thatwould a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some sayhe died there.“Po' little chap.”“But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.”“Dat's good!  But he'll be pooty lonesome--dey ain' no kings here, isdey, Huck?”“No.”“Den he cain't git no situation.  What he gwyne to do?”“Well, I don't know.  Some of them gets on the police, and some of themlearns people how to talk French.”“Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?”“_No_, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said--not a single word.”“Well, now, I be ding-busted!  How do dat come?”“I don't know; but it's so.  I got some of their jabber out of a book.S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would youthink?”“I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head--dat is, if hewarn't white.  I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat.”“Shucks, it ain't calling you anything.  It's only saying, do you knowhow to talk French?”“Well, den, why couldn't he _say_ it?”“Why, he _is_ a-saying it.  That's a Frenchman's _way_ of saying it.”“Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'boutit.  Dey ain' no sense in it.”“Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?”“No, a cat don't.”“Well, does a cow?”“No, a cow don't, nuther.”“Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?”“No, dey don't.”“It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain'tit?”“Course.”“And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk differentfrom _us_?”“Why, mos' sholy it is.”“Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talkdifferent from us?  You answer me that.”“Is a cat a man, Huck?”“No.”“Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man.  Is a cow aman?--er is a cow a cat?”“No, she ain't either of them.”“Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er theyuther of 'em.  Is a Frenchman a man?”“Yes.”“_Well_, den!  Dad blame it, why doan' he _talk_ like a man?  You answerme _dat_!”I see it warn't no use wasting words--you can't learn a nigger to argue.So I quit."

    "text": "WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottomof Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we wasafter.  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up theOhio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towheadto tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddledahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anythingbut little saplings to tie to.  I passed the line around one of themright on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, andthe raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots andaway she went.  I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick andscared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--andthen there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards.  Ijumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddleand set her back a stroke.  But she didn't come.  I was in such a hurryI hadn't untied her.  I got up and tried to untie her, but I was soexcited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, rightdown the towhead.  That was all right as far as it went, but the towheadwarn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shotout into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I wasgoing than a dead man.Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bankor a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it'smighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened.  Away down there somewheres I hears a smallwhoop, and up comes my spirits.  I went tearing after it, listeningsharp to hear it again.  The next time it come I see I warn't headingfor it, but heading away to the right of it.  And the next time I washeading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, forI was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was goingstraight ahead all the time.I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all thetime, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoopsthat was making the trouble for me.  Well, I fought along, and directlyI hears the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangled good now.  That wassomebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.I throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was behind meyet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing itsplace, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and Iwas all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't looknatural nor sound natural in a fog.The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on acut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwedme off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairlyroared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.In another second or two it was solid white and still again.  I setperfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn'tdraw a breath while it thumped a hundred.I just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut bankwas an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it.  It warn't notowhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had the big timberof a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more thanhalf a mile wide.I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.  Iwas floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don'tever think of that.  No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still onthe water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think toyourself how fast _you're_ going, but you catch your breath and think,my! how that snag's tearing along.  If you think it ain't dismal andlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try itonce--you'll see.Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hearsthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't doit, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I hadlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrowchannel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there becauseI'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trashthat hung over the banks.  Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops downamongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.  You neverknowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, tokeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged theraft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it wouldget further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a littlefaster than what I was.Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn'thear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on asnag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was good and tired, so Ilaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more.  I didn'twant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it;so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the starswas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down abig bend stern first.  First I didn't know where I was; I thought I wasdreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to comeup dim out of last week.It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickestkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could seeby the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on thewater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but acouple of sawlogs made fast together.  Then I see another speck, andchased that; then another, and this time I was right.  It was the raft.When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between hisknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  Theother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves andbranches and dirt.  So she'd had a rough time.I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began togap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn't you stir me up?”“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain' dead--you ain'drownded--you's back agin?  It's too good for true, honey, it's too goodfor true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you.  No, you ain'dead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck--de same oleHuck, thanks to goodness!”“What's the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?”“Drinkin'?  Has I ben a-drinkin'?  Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin'?”“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”“How does I talk wild?”“_How_?  Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all thatstuff, as if I'd been gone away?”“Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.  _Hain't_ youben gone away?”“Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain't been goneanywheres.  Where would I go to?”“Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is.  Is I _me_, or who_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?  Now dat's what I wants to know.”“Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're atangle-headed old fool, Jim.”“I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn't you tote out de line inde canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?”“No, I didn't.  What tow-head?  I hain't see no tow-head.”“You hain't seen no towhead?  Looky here, didn't de line pull loose ende raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine inde fog?”“What fog?”“Why, de fog!--de fog dat's been aroun' all night.  En didn't you whoop,en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us gotlos' en t'other one was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know whahhe wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turribletime en mos' git drownded?  Now ain' dat so, boss--ain't it so?  Youanswer me dat.”“Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain't seen no fog, nor noislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting here talking withyou all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckonI done the same.  You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of courseyou've been dreaming.”“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of ithappen.”“But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as--”“It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it.I know, because I've been here all the time.”Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studyingover it.  Then he says:“Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain'tde powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo'dat's tired me like dis one.”“Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body likeeverything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream; tell me allabout it, Jim.”So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just asit happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he said he muststart in and “'terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning.  He saidthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, butthe current was another man that would get us away from him.  The whoopswas warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn'ttry hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into badluck, 'stead of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubleswe was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of meanfolks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravatethem, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the bigclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no moretrouble.It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but itwas clearing up again now.“Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,” Isays; “but what does _these_ things stand for?”It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  Youcould see them first-rate now.Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trashagain.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that hecouldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its placeagain right away.  But when he did get the thing straightened around helooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:“What do dey stan' for?  I'se gwyne to tell you.  When I got all woreout wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuzmos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' what becomeer me en de raf'.  En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safeen soun', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo'foot, I's so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you couldmake a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.  Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trashis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'emashamed.”Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there withoutsaying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It made me feel so meanI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humblemyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for itafterwards, neither.  I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and Iwouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feel that way."

    "text": "WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind amonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She hadfour long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirtymen, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an opencamp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was apower of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsmanon such a craft as that.We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and gothot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber onboth sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  Wetalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got toit.  I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't butabout a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them litup, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the twobig rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybewe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into thesame old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the questionwas, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, andwas a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was toCairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it andwaited.There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, andnot pass it without seeing it.  He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed ithe'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Everylittle while he jumps up and says:“Dah she is?”But it warn't.  It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he setdown again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made himall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I cantell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--andwho was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn't get that out of myconscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn'trest; I couldn't stay still in one place.  It hadn't ever come home tome before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and itstayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out tomyself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from hisrightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, everytime, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could apaddled ashore and told somebody.”  That was so--I couldn't get aroundthat noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, “Whathad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go offright under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poorold woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried tolearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried tobe good to you every way she knowed how.  _That's_ what she done.”I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.  Ifidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim wasfidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, “Dah's Cairo!” it went through melike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die ofmiserableness.Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.  He wassaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State hewould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when hegot enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close towhere Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy thetwo children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get anAb'litionist to go and steal them.It most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn't ever dared to talk suchtalk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it made in him theminute he judged he was about free.  It was according to the old saying,“Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.”  Thinks I, this is whatcomes of my not thinking.  Here was this nigger, which I had as goodas helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he wouldsteal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; aman that hadn't ever done me no harm.I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  Myconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I saysto it, “Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore at thefirst light and tell.”  I felt easy and happy and light as a featherright off.  All my troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for alight, and sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim singsout:“We's safe, Huck, we's safe!  Jump up and crack yo' heels!  Dat's degood ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!”I says:“I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn't be, you know.”He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottomfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:“Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all onaccounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef ithadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck;you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de _only_ fren' ole Jim'sgot now.”I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he saysthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I went alongslow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I startedor whether I warn't.  When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' hispromise to ole Jim.”Well, I just felt sick.  But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can't get _out_of it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, andthey stopped and I stopped.  One of them says:“What's that yonder?”“A piece of a raft,” I says.“Do you belong on it?”“Yes, sir.”“Any men on it?”“Only one, sir.”“Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the headof the bend.  Is your man white or black?”I didn't answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. Itried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't manenough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit.  I see I was weakening; so I justgive up trying, and up and says:“He's white.”“I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.”“I wish you would,” says I, “because it's pap that's there, and maybeyou'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.  He's sick--and sois mam and Mary Ann.”“Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy.  But I s'pose we've got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along.”I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we had made astroke or two, I says:“Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.  Everybody goesaway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do itby myself.”“Well, that's infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what's the matterwith your father?”“It's the--a--the--well, it ain't anything much.”They stopped pulling.  It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raftnow. One says:“Boy, that's a lie.  What _is_ the matter with your pap?  Answer upsquare now, and it'll be the better for you.”“I will, sir, I will, honest--but don't leave us, please.  It'sthe--the--Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you theheadline, you won't have to come a-near the raft--please do.”“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one.  They backed water.  “Keepaway, boy--keep to looard.  Confound it, I just expect the wind hasblowed it to us.  Your pap's got the small-pox, and you know it preciouswell.  Why didn't you come out and say so?  Do you want to spread it allover?”“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I've told everybody before, and they justwent away and left us.”“Poor devil, there's something in that.  We are right down sorry foryou, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see.  Lookhere, I'll tell you what to do.  Don't you try to land by yourself, oryou'll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twentymiles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  Itwill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell themyour folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don't be a fool again,and let people guess what is the matter.  Now we're trying to do you akindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only awood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he'sin pretty hard luck.  Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on thisboard, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leaveyou; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?”“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here's a twenty to put on theboard for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'llbe all right.”“That's so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any runaway niggersyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if Ican help it.”They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because Iknowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for meto try to learn to do right; a body that don't get _started_ right whenhe's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothingto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then Ithought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done rightand give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, saysI, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, saysI, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to doright and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck.  I couldn't answer that.  So I reckoned I wouldn't botherno more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest atthe time.I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there.  I looked all around; hewarn't anywhere.  I says:“Jim!”“Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o' sight yit?  Don't talk loud.”He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  I toldhim they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He says:“I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyneto shove for sho' if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne to swim to deraf' agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck! Dat _wuz_ de smartes' dodge!  I tell you, chile, I'spec it save' oleJim--ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey.”Then we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twentydollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboatnow, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the freeStates. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but hewished we was already there.Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hidingthe raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, andgetting all ready to quit rafting.That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away downin a left-hand bend.I went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man outin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I ranged up and says:“Mister, is that town Cairo?”“Cairo? no.  You must be a blame' fool.”“What town is it, mister?”“If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here botherin'around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something youwon't want.”I paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said nevermind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; butit was high ground, so I didn't go.  No high ground about Cairo, Jimsaid. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerableclose to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So didJim.  I says:“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”He says:“Doan' le's talk about it, Huck.  Po' niggers can't have no luck.  Iawluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work.”“I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I'd never laideyes on it.”“It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know.  Don't you blame yo'self'bout it.”When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sureenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up withCairo.We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn'ttake the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't no way but to waitfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we sleptall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!We didn't say a word for a good while.  There warn't anything tosay.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of therattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would onlylook like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch morebad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keepstill.By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't noway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buya canoe to go back in.  We warn't going to borrow it when there warn'tanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people afterus.So we shoved out after dark on the raft.Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle asnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe itnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But wedidn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours andmore.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the nextmeanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape of the river, and youcan't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then alongcomes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged shewould see it.  Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; theygo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; butnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till shewas close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to seehow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites offa sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinkshe's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going totry and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  Shewas a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a blackcloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulgedout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shininglike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging rightover us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop theengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim wentoverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straightthrough the raft.I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheelhad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I couldalways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under aminute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I wasnearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out ofmy nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; andof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after shestopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she waschurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though Icould hear her.I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” andstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to seethat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, whichmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a goodlong time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up thebank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along overrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across abig old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going torush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howlingand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg."

    "text": "IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting hishead out, and says:“Be done, boys!  Who's there?”I says:“It's me.”“Who's me?”“George Jackson, sir.”“What do you want?”“I don't want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but the dogswon't let me.”“What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?”“I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.”“Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What did yousay your name was?”“George Jackson, sir.  I'm only a boy.”“Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'llhurt you.  But don't try to budge; stand right where you are.  Rouse outBob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is thereanybody with you?”“No, sir, nobody.”I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.The man sung out:“Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain't you got any sense?Put it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob, if you and Tom areready, take your places.”“All ready.”“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?”“No, sir; I never heard of them.”“Well, that may be so, and it mayn't.  Now, all ready.  Step forward,George Jackson.  And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow.  If there'sanybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he'll be shot.Come along now.  Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough tosqueeze in, d' you hear?”I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to.  I took one slow step ata time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behindme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking andunbarring and unbolting.  I put my hand on the door and pushed it alittle and a little more till somebody said, “There, that's enough--putyour head in.” I done it, but I judged they would take it off.The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, andme at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three big men with gunspointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, grayand about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine andhandsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her twoyoung women which I couldn't see right well.  The old gentleman says:“There; I reckon it's all right.  Come in.”As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred itand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, andthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the frontwindows--there warn't none on the side.  They held the candle, and took agood look at me, and all said, “Why, _he_ ain't a Shepherdson--no, thereain't any Shepherdson about him.”  Then the old man said he hoped Iwouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm byit--it was only to make sure.  So he didn't pry into my pockets, but onlyfelt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me tomake myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the oldlady says:“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don'tyou reckon it may be he's hungry?”“True for you, Rachel--I forgot.”So the old lady says:“Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “you fly around and get him somethingto eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wakeup Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself.  Buck, take this littlestranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in someof yours that's dry.”Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,though he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn't on anything but ashirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in gaping and digging onefist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.He says:“Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?”They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.“Well,” he says, “if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one.”They all laughed, and Bob says:“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow incoming.”“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; Idon't get no show.”“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you'll have show enough,all in good time, don't you fret about that.  Go 'long with you now, anddo as your mother told you.”When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and aroundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at it heasked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started totell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woodsday before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candlewent out.  I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.“Well, guess,” he says.“How'm I going to guess,” says I, “when I never heard tell of itbefore?”“But you can guess, can't you?  It's just as easy.”“_Which_ candle?”  I says.“Why, any candle,” he says.“I don't know where he was,” says I; “where was he?”“Why, he was in the _dark_!  That's where he was!”“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”“Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see?  Say, how long are yougoing to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just have boomingtimes--they don't have no school now.  Do you own a dog?  I've got adog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.  Doyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You betI don't, but ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckonI'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm.  Are you allready? All right.  Come along, old hoss.”Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what theyhad for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I'vecome across yet.  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  Theyall smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women hadquilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked mequestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was livingon a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Annrun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill wentto hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was justtrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he diedI took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, andstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was howI come to be here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as Iwanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and Iwent to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying tothink, and when Buck waked up I says:“Can you spell, Buck?”“Yes,” he says.“I bet you can't spell my name,” says I.“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,” he says.“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn't think you could.  It ain't noslouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.”I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell itnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I wasused to it.It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn'tseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so muchstyle.  It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden onewith a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses intown. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heapsof parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace thatwas bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red bypouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimesthey wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could holdup a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, witha picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, anda round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see thependulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured herup and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundredand fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn't took any money forher.Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of theparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't opentheir mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked throughunderneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread outbehind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kindof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches andgrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettierthan real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see wherepieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever itwas, underneath.This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red andblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  Itcome all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was abig family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about aman that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in itnow and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another wasFriendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn'tread the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a bodywas sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  Andthere was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not baggeddown in the middle and busted, like an old basket.They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing theDeclaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of thedaughters which was dead made her own self when she was onlyfifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever seebefore--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim blackdress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage inthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet witha black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, andvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on atombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other handhanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”  Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straightto the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like achair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead birdlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneaththe picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”  There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at themoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter inone hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she wasmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneaththe picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.”  Thesewas all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to taketo them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me thefan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lotmore of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had donewhat they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she washaving a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what theysaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day andevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got itdone, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young womanin a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jumpoff, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, withthe tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across herbreast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching uptowards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she diedbefore she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over thehead of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hungflowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The youngwoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was somany arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to pasteobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of thePresbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the nameof Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'DAnd did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? And did thesad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?No; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sadhearts round him thickened,    'Twas not from sickness' shots.No whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;Not these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.Despised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots, Norstomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.O no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell. His souldid from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.They got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late; His spiritwas gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she wasfourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by.  Bucksaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She didn't ever have tostop to think.  He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn'tfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap downanother one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write aboutanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be onhand with her “tribute” before he was cold.  She called them tributes.The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then theundertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, andthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which wasWhistler.  She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,but she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many's thetime I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and getout her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had beenaggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all thatfamily, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come betweenus.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she wasalive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make someabout her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or twomyself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline'sroom trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way sheliked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plentyof niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible theremostly.Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains onthe windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vinesall down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.  There was a littleold piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was everso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken” and play “The Battle of Prague” on it.  The walls of all the rooms wasplastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house waswhitewashed on the outside.It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofedand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of theday, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing couldn't be better. And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!"

    "text": "COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman allover; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, andthat's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglassaid, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracyin our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no morequality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall andvery slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in itanywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, andhe had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, anda high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk sodeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns atyou, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black andstraight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, andevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from headto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  Hecarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't nofrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He wasas kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you hadconfidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when hestraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun toflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have totell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-manneredwhere he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshinemost always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turnedinto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that wasenough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family gotup out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down againtill they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard wherethe decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, andhe held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, andthen they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar andthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, andgive it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broadshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  Theydressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, andwore broad Panama hats.Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proudand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; butwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,like her father.  She was beautiful.So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She wasgentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My niggerhad a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody doanything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.This was all there was of the family now, but there used to bemore--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten orfifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketingsround about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woodsdaytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostlykinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was ahandsome lot of quality, I tell you.There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or sixfamilies--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-tonedand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  TheShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which wasabout two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with alot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on theirfine horses.One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horsecoming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:“Quick!  Jump for the woods!”We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Prettysoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting hishorse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across hispommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  Iheard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from hishead.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we washid.  But we didn't wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  Thewoods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode awaythe way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.  We neverstopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's eyes blazed aminute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smootheddown, and he says, kind of gentle:“I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn't you stepinto the road, my boy?”“The Shepherdsons don't, father.  They always take advantage.”Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was tellinghis tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two youngmen looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees byourselves, I says:“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”“Well, I bet I did.”“What did he do to you?”“Him?  He never done nothing to me.”“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”“Why, nothing--only it's on account of the feud.”“What's a feud?”“Why, where was you raised?  Don't you know what a feud is?”“Never heard of it before--tell me about it.”“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel withanother man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain'tno more feud.  But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.”“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”“Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som'ers alongthere.  There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settleit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot theman that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybodywould.”“What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?”“I reckon maybe--I don't know.”“Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”“Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.”“Don't anybody know?”“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but theydon't know now what the row was about in the first place.”“Has there been many killed, Buck?”“Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don't always kill.  Pa'sgot a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weighmuch, anyway.  Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's beenhurt once or twice.”“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”“Yes; we got one and they got one.  'Bout three months ago my cousinBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other sideof the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behindhim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun inhis hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumpingoff and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so theyhad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining allthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and facedaround so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the oldman he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn't git much chance toenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”“I reckon he _warn't_ a coward.  Not by a blame' sight.  There ain't acoward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain't no cowardsamongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep' up his end in afight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and comeout winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and gotbehind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop thebullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered aroundthe old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but theGrangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, andanother died the next day.  No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowardshe don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuzthey don't breed any of that _kind_.”Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybodya-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and keptthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  TheShepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all aboutbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it wasa good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had sucha powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace andpreforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to meto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in theirchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck anda dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went upto our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweetMiss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she tookme in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her andnot tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot herTestament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not saynothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up theroad, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floorin summer-time because it's cool.  If you notice, most folks don't go tochurch only when they've got to; but a hog is different.Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be insuch a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops alittle piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote on it with a pencil.  Iransacked it, but couldn't find anything else.  I couldn't make anythingout of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got homeand upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  Shepulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament tillshe found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; andbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, andsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She wasmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and itmade her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I gotmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if Ihad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paperwarn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go andplay now.I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soonI noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was outof sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comesa-running, and says:“Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a wholestack o' water-moccasins.”Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughterknow a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting forthem. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:“All right; trot ahead.”I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and wadedankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat pieceof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,and he says:“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'.”Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hidhim.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patchas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man layingthere asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise tohim to see me again, but it warn't.  He nearly cried he was so glad, buthe warn't surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heardme yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody topick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:“I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable waysbehine you towards de las'; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketchup wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dathouse I begin to go slow.  I 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say toyou--I wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowedyou's in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day.  Earlyin de mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en deytuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on accountso' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me howyou's a-gitt'n along.”“Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?”“Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--butwe's all right now.  I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got achanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when--”“_What_ raft, Jim?”“Our ole raf'.”“You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?”“No, she warn't.  She was tore up a good deal--one en' of her was; butdey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'.  Ef wehadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn' benso dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin'is, we'd a seed de raf'.  But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase nowshe's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o'stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.”“Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?”“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er de niggersfoun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in acrick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'umshe b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I upsen settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, butto you en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman'spropaty, en git a hid'n for it?  Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along enmake 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whateverI wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey.  Dat Jack'sa good nigger, en pooty smart.”“Yes, he is.  He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, andhe'd show me a lot of water-moccasins.  If anything happens _he_ ain'tmixed up in it.  He can say he never seen us together, and it 'll be thetruth.”I don't want to talk much about the next day.  I reckon I'll cut itpretty short.  I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over andgo to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn't seem to beanybody stirring.  That warn't usual.  Next I noticed that Buck wasup and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobodyaround; everything as still as a mouse.  Just the same outside.  ThinksI, what does it mean?  Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, andsays:“What's it all about?”Says he:“Don't you know, Mars Jawge?”“No,” says I, “I don't.”“Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has.  She run off in denight some time--nobody don't know jis' when; run off to get marriedto dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey 'spec.  Defambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo'--en' I_tell_ you dey warn't no time los'.  Sich another hurryin' up gunsen hosses _you_ never see!  De women folks has gone for to stir up derelations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up deriver road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kingit acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.  I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mightyrough times.”“Buck went off 'thout waking me up.”“Well, I reck'n he _did_!  Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home aShepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, en youbet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”I took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I begin tohear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the log store andthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the treesand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into theforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There was awood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first Iwas going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the openplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get ata couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of thesteamboat landing; but they couldn't come it.  Every time one of themshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.  Thetwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watchboth ways.By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They startedriding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steadybead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.  Allthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and startedto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on therun.  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out afterthem.  They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys hadtoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap aboutnineteen years old.The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as they wasout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn't know whatto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.  He was awfulsurprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when themen come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment orother--wouldn't be gone long.  I wished I was out of that tree, but Idasn't come down.  Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him andhis cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for thisday yet.  He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and twoor three of the enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them inambush.  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for theirrelations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I asked him whatwas become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He said they'd got acrossthe river and was safe.  I was glad of that; but the way Buck did takeon because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--Ihain't ever heard anything like it.All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men hadslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without theirhorses!  The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as theyswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them andsinging out, “Kill them, kill them!”  It made me so sick I most fell outof the tree.  I ain't a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would makeme sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn't ever come ashorethat night to see such things.  I ain't ever going to get shut ofthem--lots of times I dream about them.I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen littlegangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned thetrouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up mymind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned Iwas to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that MissSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; andI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious wayshe acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful messwouldn't ever happened.When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank apiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, andtugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,and got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was coveringup Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.It was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck throughthe woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn't on his island, so Itramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft wasgone!  My souls, but I was scared!  I couldn't get my breath for mosta minute. Then I raised a yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from mesays:“Good lan'! is dat you, honey?  Doan' make no noise.”It was Jim's voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  I run along thebank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he wasso glad to see me.  He says:“Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin.  Jack'sbeen heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home nomo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf erde crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jackcomes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.  Lawsy, I's mightyglad to git you back again, honey.”I says:“All right--that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll thinkI've been killed, and floated down the river--there's something up therethat 'll help them think so--so don't you lose no time, Jim, but justshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out inthe middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal lantern, andjudged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn't had a bite to eatsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain't nothing in the world so goodwhen it's cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had agood time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so wasJim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn't no home like araft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but araft don't.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft."

    "text": "TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we putin the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mileand a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon asnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly alwaysin the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods andwillows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Nextwe slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cooloff; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about kneedeep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectlystill--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogsa-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over thewater, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; youcouldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then morepaleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, andwarn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spotsdrifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; andlong black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; orjumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by andby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of thestreak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on itand makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up offof the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out alog-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side ofthe river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you canthrow a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, andcomes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smellon account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and theydo get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everythingsmiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish offof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watchthe lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and bylazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, andmaybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards theother side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she wasa stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't benothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Nextyou'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on itchopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see theaxe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe goup again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So wewould put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Oncethere was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beatingtin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or araft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing andlaughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it madeyou feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:“No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'”Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about themiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wantedher to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, andtalked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks madefor me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much onclothes, nohow.Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longesttime. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybea spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the wateryou could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybeyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckledwith stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, anddiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim heallowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it wouldhave took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothingagainst it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course itcould be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see themstreak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of thenest.Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in thedark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up outof her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awfulpretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out andher powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by herwaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle theraft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn'ttell how long, except maybe frogs or something.After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two orthree hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meantmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute tothe main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mileup a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get someberries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossedthe crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight asthey could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody wasafter anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig outfrom there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sungout and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doingnothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogsa-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:“Don't you do it.  I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got timeto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then youtake to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogsoff the scent.”They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn'tsee them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we gotfurther and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them atall; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck theriver, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hidin the cottonwoods and was safe.One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald headand very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, anda greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffedinto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He hadan old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung overhis arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  Afterbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come outwas that these chaps didn't know one another.“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t'other chap.“Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--andit does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but Istayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the actof sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, andyou told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.  SoI told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_you. That's the whole yarn--what's yourn?“Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week,and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' itmighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin' as much as fiveor six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--andbusiness a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little reportgot around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with aprivate jug on the sly.  A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and toldme the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, andthey'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start,and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tarand feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.  I didn't wait for nobreakfast--I warn't hungry.”“Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we might double-team ittogether; what do you think?”“I ain't undisposed.  What's your line--mainly?”“Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;theater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenologywhen there's a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;sling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything thatcomes handy, so it ain't work.  What's your lay?”“I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.  Layin' on o'hands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and Ik'n tell a fortune pretty good when I've got somebody along to find outthe facts for me.  Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's,and missionaryin' around.”Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sighand says:“Alas!”“What 're you alassin' about?” says the bald-head.“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degradeddown into such company.”  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eyewith a rag.“Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?” says thebaldhead, pretty pert and uppish.“Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for whofetched me so low when I was so high?  I did myself.  I don't blame_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don't blame anybody.  I deserve itall.  Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there's a gravesomewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and takeeverything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can't takethat. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor brokenheart will be at rest.”  He went on a-wiping.“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what are you heavingyour pore broken heart at _us_ f'r?  _we_ hain't done nothing.”“No, I know you haven't.  I ain't blaming you, gentlemen.  I broughtmyself down--yes, I did it myself.  It's right I should suffer--perfectlyright--I don't make any moan.”“Brought you down from whar?  Whar was you brought down from?”“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--'tisno matter.  The secret of my birth--”“The secret of your birth!  Do you mean to say--”“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you,for I feel I may have confidence in you.  By rights I am a duke!”Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.Then the baldhead says:  “No! you can't mean it?”“Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fledto this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pureair of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own fatherdying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized thetitles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the linealdescendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; andhere am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despisedby the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to thecompanionship of felons on a raft!”Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, buthe said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if wewas a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than mostanything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said weought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; andone of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing forhim he wanted done.Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stoodaround and waited on him, and says, “Will yo' Grace have some o' dis orsome o' dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing tohim.But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn't have much to say, anddidn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going onaround that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, alongin the afternoon, he says:“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I'm nation sorry for you, but youain't the only person that's had troubles like that.”“No?”“No you ain't.  You ain't the only person that's ben snaked downwrongfully out'n a high place.”“Alas!”“No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.”  And,by jings, _he_ begins to cry.“Hold!  What do you mean?”“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.“To the bitter death!”  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,and says, “That secret of your being:  speak!”“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:“You are what?”“Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very momenton the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy theSixteen and Marry Antonette.”“You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you mustbe six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brungthese gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, yousee before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled,trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.”Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what todo, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and donewith it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feeleasier and better for a while if people treated him according to hisrights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him“Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set downin his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till hetold us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so hegot cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, anddidn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke'sgreat-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a gooddeal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palaceconsiderable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by theking says:“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yerraft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour?  It 'll onlymake things oncomfortable.  It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,it ain't your fault you warn't born a king--so what's the use to worry? Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto. This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here--plenty grub and an easylife--come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be friends.”The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It tookaway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, becauseit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on theraft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybodyto be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't nokings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But Inever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble.  If theywanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long asit would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, soI didn't tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learntthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let themhave their own way."

    "text": "THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what wecovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead ofrunning--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:“Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?”No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, soI says:“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, andthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowedhe'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a littleone-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa waspretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn'tnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn'tenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketchedthis piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it. Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner ofthe raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only fouryears old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day ortwo we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out inskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he wasa runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don'tbother us.”The duke says:“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if wewant to.  I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go bythat town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.”Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heatlightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves wasbeginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to seethat.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to seewhat the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shucktick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dryshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; itmakes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he wouldtake my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you thata corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on.  Your Grace 'lltake the shuck bed yourself.”Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there wasgoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad whenthe duke says:“'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel ofoppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, Isubmit; 'tis my fate.  I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bearit.”We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to standwell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till wegot a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch oflights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a halfa mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below wehoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rainand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told usto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the dukecrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watchbelow till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, notby a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And everysecond or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a halfa mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumblingand grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash andanother sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no troubleabout snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constantthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way orthat and miss them.I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was alwaysmighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the kingand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show forme; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, andthe waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, becausehe reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he wasmistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes aregular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and bythe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showedI rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for theday.The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and himand the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they gottired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as they calledit. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot oflittle printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, “Thecelebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “lecture on theScience of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day ofblank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character attwenty-five cents apiece.”  The duke said that was _him_.  In anotherbill he was the “world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick theYounger, of Drury Lane, London.”  In other bills he had a lot of othernames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold witha “divining-rod,” “dissipating witch spells,” and so on.  By and by hesays:“But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,Royalty?”“No,” says the king.“You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,” saysthe duke.  “The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do thesword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.How does that strike you?”“I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, yousee, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen muchof it.  I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace.  Do youreckon you can learn me?”“Easy!”“All right.  I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway.  Le'scommence right away.”So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, andsaid he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.“But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my whitewhiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”“No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all thedifference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlightbefore she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her rufflednightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.”He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said wasmeedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long whitecotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king wassatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in themost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the sametime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to theking and told him to get his part by heart.There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, andafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to runin daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he wouldgo down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,too, and see if he couldn't strike something.  We was out of coffee, soJim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, andperfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunninghimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young ortoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in thewoods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work thatcamp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters andprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures ofhorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shedhis coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out forthe camp-meeting.We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a mostawful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there fromtwenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitchedeverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keepoff the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over withbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles ofwatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they wasbigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outsideslabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks intofor legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platformsto stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of theyoung ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, andsome of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linenshirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folkswas courting on the sly.The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He linedout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; thenhe lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke upmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end somebegun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun topreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side ofthe platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the frontof it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting hiswords out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold uphis Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way andthat, shouting, “It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look uponit and live!”  And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!”  And sohe went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:“Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn andsoiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contriteheart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanseis free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!” (_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)And so on.  You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, onaccount of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in thecrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all themourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung andshouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear himover everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, andthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  Hetold them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in theIndian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring ina fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks togoodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboatwithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing thatever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy forthe first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to startright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the restof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he coulddo it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crewsin that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get therewithout money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinceda pirate he would say to him, “Don't you thank me, don't you give me nocredit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacherthere, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebodysings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”  Well,a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_pass the hat around!”  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for beingso good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while theprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, wouldup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and healways done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five orsix times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him tolive in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he saidas this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, andbesides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go towork on the pirates.When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he hadcollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he hadfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under awagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in themissionarying line.  He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don'tamount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king cometo show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.  He had setup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in thatprinting-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And hehad got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which hesaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--sothey done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he tookin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of thempaying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions asusual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down theprice as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out ofhis own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all setup and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a prettysquare day's work for it.Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't chargedfor, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger witha bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.  Thereading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It saidhe run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and sendhim back he could have the reward and expenses.“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if wewant to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and footwith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say wecaptured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going downto get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too muchlike jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,as we say on the boards.”We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no troubleabout running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that nightto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work inthe printing office was going to make in that little town; then we couldboom right along if we wanted to.We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly teno'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn'thoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:“Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on distrip?”“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”“Well,” says he, “dat's all right, den.  I doan' mine one er two kings,but dat's enough.  Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' muchbetter.”I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hearwhat it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, andhad so much trouble, he'd forgot it."

    "text": "IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up.  Theking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but afterthey'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a gooddeal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legsdangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and wentto getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it prettygood him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had tolearn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made himsigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he doneit pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn't bellow out _Romeo_!that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child ofa girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass.”Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made outof oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke calledhimself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced aroundthe raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and felloverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about allkinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.After dinner the duke says:“Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, soI guess we'll add a little more to it.  We want a little something toanswer encores with, anyway.”“What's onkores, Bilgewater?”The duke told him, and then says:“I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe; andyou--well, let me see--oh, I've got it--you can do Hamlet's soliloquy.”“Hamlet's which?”“Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.Ah, it's sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the house.  I haven't gotit in the book--I've only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it outfrom memory.  I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can callit back from recollection's vaults.”So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horribleevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he wouldsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; nexthe would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear.  It was beautifulto see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Thenhe strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and hisarms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up hischest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before. This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning itto the king:To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity ofso long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do cometo Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders theinnocent sleep, Great nature's second course, And makes us rather slingthe arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.There's the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! Iwould thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Theoppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The law's delay, and thequietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of thenight, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, Butthat the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue ofresolution, like the poor cat i' the adage, Is sicklied o'er with care.And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops, With thisregard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. 'Tis aconsummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Openot thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so hecould do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and whenhe had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way hewould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; andafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was amost uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fightingand rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sightof a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up aboutthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which wasshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim tookthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in thatplace for our show.We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there thatafternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, inall kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leavebefore night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke hehired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. Theyread like this:Shaksperean Revival!!!Wonderful Attraction!For One Night Only! The world renowned tragedians,David Garrick the younger, of Drury Lane Theatre, London,andEdmund Kean the elder, of the Royal Haymarket Theatre, Whitechapel,Pudding Lane, Piccadilly, London, and the Royal Continental Theatres, intheir sublime Shaksperean Spectacle entitled The Balcony Scene inRomeo and Juliet!!!Romeo......................................

The stores and houses was most allold shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; theywas set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out ofreach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had littlegardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything inthem but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-upboots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-outtin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed onat different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates thatdidn't generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fenceshad been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was inClumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, andpeople driving them out.All the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic awnings infront, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roostingon them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; andchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornerylot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, andused considerable many cuss words.  There was as many as one loaferleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his handsin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chawof tobacco or scratch.  What a body was hearing amongst them all thetime was:“Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank.”“Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill.”Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't gotnone. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor achaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all their chawing by borrowing;they say to a fellow, “I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist thisminute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”--which is a lie prettymuch everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't nostranger, so he says:“_You_ give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister's cat'sgrandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me,Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't chargeyou no back intrust, nuther.”“Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.”“Yes, you did--'bout six chaws.  You borry'd store tobacker and paid backnigger-head.”Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws thenatural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut itoff with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw withtheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it intwo; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at itwhen it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:“Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.”All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else _but_mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.  The hogs loafed andgrunted around everywheres.  You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigscome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut hereyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look ashappy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafersing out, “Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go,squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, andthree or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all theloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the funand look grateful for the noise.  Then they'd settle back again tillthere was a dog fight.  There couldn't anything wake them up all over,and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might beputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying atin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The peoplehad moved out of them.  The bank was caved away under one corner of someothers, and that corner was hanging over.  People lived in them yet, butit was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a housecaves in at a time.  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deepwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into theriver in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was thewagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat themin the wagons.  There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and Iseen three fights.  By and by somebody sings out:“Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthlydrunk; here he comes, boys!”All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun outof Boggs.  One of them says:“Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he'd a-chawed up allthe men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd haveconsiderable ruputation now.”Another one says, “I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd knowI warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year.”Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like anInjun, and singing out:“Cler the track, thar.  I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins isa-gwyne to raise.”He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty yearold, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed athim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them andlay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now becausehe'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, “Meatfirst, and spoon vittles to top off on.”He see me, and rode up and says:“Whar'd you come f'm, boy?  You prepared to die?”Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:“He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he'sdrunk.  He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,drunk nor sober.”Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head downso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:“Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!”And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongueto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing andgoing on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was aheap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, andthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,mighty ca'm and slow--he says:“I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.  Till oneo'clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only onceafter that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.”Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobodystirred, and there warn't no more laughing.  Boggs rode offblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keepingit up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteenminutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn'tdo no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat downin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging downthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could geta chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so theycould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the streethe would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and bysomebody says:“Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listento her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.”So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on hishorse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, witha friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but wasdoing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:“Boggs!”I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that ColonelSherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had apistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out withthe barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a younggirl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turnedround to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the menjumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady toa level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,“O Lord, don't shoot!”  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwardson to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That younggirl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on herfather, crying, and saying, “Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!”  Thecrowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, withtheir necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying toshove them back and shouting, “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turnedaround on his heels and walked off.They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around justthe same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a goodplace at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  Theylaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and openedanother one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirtfirst, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about adozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in hisbreath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after thathe laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away fromhim, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, andvery sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging andpushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but peoplethat had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them wassaying all the time, “Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, andnever give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well asyou.”There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybethere was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody wasexcited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with longhair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and acrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggsstood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around fromone place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing theirheads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting theirhands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground withhis cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn hadstood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sungout, “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says“Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat onhis back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as adozen people got out their bottles and treated him.Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about aminute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, andsnatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with."

    "text": "THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging likeInjuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and trompedto mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of themob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window alongthe road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in everytree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as themob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out ofreach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scaredmost to death.They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they couldjam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.  Itwas a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out “Tear down the fence! teardown the fence!”  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing andsmashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins toroll in like a wave.Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectlyca'm and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and thewave sucked back.Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  Thestillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slowalong the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little toout-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and lookedsneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasantkind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating breadthat's got sand in it.Then he says, slow and scornful:“The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It's amusing.  The idea of youthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you're braveenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come alonghere, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a_man_?  Why, a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--aslong as it's daytime and you're not behind him.“Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in theSouth, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around.The average man's a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over himthat wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of menin the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you abrave people so much that you think you are braver than any otherpeople--whereas you're just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don't yourjuries hang murderers?  Because they're afraid the man's friends willshoot them in the back, in the dark--and it's just what they _would_ do.“So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with ahundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistakeis, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and theother is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks.  Youbrought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn't had himto start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.“You didn't want to come.  The average man don't like trouble anddanger. _You_ don't like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ aman--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you'reafraid to back down--afraid you'll be found out to be what youare--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to thathalf-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what bigthings you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that'swhat an army is--a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born inthem, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from theirofficers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_pitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails andgo home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching's going to be done itwill be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'llbring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take yourhalf-a-man with you”--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cockingit when he says this.The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearingoff every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, lookingtolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchmanwent by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar goldpiece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, becausethere ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away fromhome and amongst strangers that way.  You can't be too careful.  I ain'topposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, butthere ain't no use in _wasting_ it on them.It was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever waswhen they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, sideby side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoesnor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy andcomfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with alovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gangof real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions ofdollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got upand stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy andgraceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with theirheads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, andevery lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first onefoot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more andmore, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, crackinghis whip and shouting “Hi!--hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behindhim; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put herknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then howthe horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after theother they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow Iever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands andwent just about wild.Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; andall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  Theringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quickas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what Icouldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year.And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted toride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They arguedand tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole showcome to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and makefun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so thatstirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of thebenches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw himout!” and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmasterhe made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be nodisturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no moretrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minutehe was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and thedrunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air everyjump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughingtill tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus mencould do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hangingto his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  Itwarn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up anddropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afiretoo.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortableas if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off hisclothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged upthe air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there hewas, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest youever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairlyhum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off tothe dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure andastonishment.Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ thesickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his ownmen!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let onto nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn'ta been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don'tknow; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but Inever struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; andwherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn't only about twelvepeople there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all thetime, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, beforethe show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said theseArkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wantedwas low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, hereckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he gotsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed offsome handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:"

    "text": "WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage anda curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the housewas jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn't hold no more,the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come onto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest onethat ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and aboutEdmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, herolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancingout on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as arainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; andwhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, theyroared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and doneit over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, itwould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and saysthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts ofpressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for itin Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he hassucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeplyobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to comeand see it.Twenty people sings out:“What, is it over?  Is that _all_?”The duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody singsout, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and themtragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:“Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen.”  They stopped to listen.  “We aresold--mighty badly sold.  But we don't want to be the laughing stock ofthis whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as longas we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talkthis show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we'll all be in thesame boat.  Ain't that sensible?” (“You bet it is!--the jedge is right!” everybody sings out.) “All right, then--not a word about any sell.  Goalong home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.”Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendidthat show was.  House was jammed again that night, and we sold thiscrowd the same way.  When me and the king and the duke got home to theraft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jimand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, andfetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comersthis time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  Istood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in hadhis pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see itwarn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggsby the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know thesigns of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-fourof them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too variousfor me; I couldn't stand it.  Well, when the place couldn't hold no morepeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend doorfor him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I afterhim; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:“Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for theraft like the dickens was after you!”I done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the same time,and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark andstill, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying aword. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with theaudience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from underthe wigwam, and says:“Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?”  He hadn't beenup-town at all.We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairlylaughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people.  Theduke says:“Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum and letthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us thethird night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.  Well, it _is_ theirturn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it.  I_would_ just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plentyprovisions.”Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in thatthree nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like thatbefore.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:“Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”“No,” I says, “it don't.”“Why don't it, Huck?”“Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.  I reckon they're allalike.”“But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist whatdey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.”“Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, asfur as I can make out.”“Is dat so?”“You read about them once--you'll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.  And look at Charles Second,and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and EdwardSecond, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxonheptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He _was_ ablossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her headnext morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he wasordering up eggs.  'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.  They fetch her up.Next morning, 'Chop off her head!'  And they chop it off.  'Fetch upJane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off herhead'--and they chop it off.  'Ring up Fair Rosamun.'  Fair Rosamunanswers the bell.  Next morning, 'Chop off her head.'  And he made everyone of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he hadhogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in abook, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated thecase.  You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old ripof ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history.  Well, Henry hetakes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. Howdoes he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show?  No.  All of asudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacksout a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.  That was_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of hisfather, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to showup?  No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.  S'pose peopleleft money laying around where he was--what did he do?  He collared it. S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't setdown there and see that he done it--what did he do?  He always done theother thing. S'pose he opened his mouth--what then?  If he didn't shut itup powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time.  That's the kind of a bugHenry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooledthat town a heap worse than ourn done.  I don't say that ourn is lambs,because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but theyain't nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,and you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they're a mightyornery lot. It's the way they're raised.”“But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.”“Well, they all do, Jim.  We can't help the way a king smells; historydon't tell no way.”“Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways.”“Yes, a duke's different.  But not very different.  This one'sa middling hard lot for a duke.  When he's drunk there ain't nonear-sighted man could tell him from a king.”“Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck.  Dese is all Ikin stan'.”“It's the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we've got them on our hands, and wegot to remember what they are, and make allowances.  Sometimes I wish wecould hear of a country that's out of kings.”What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes?  Itwouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  youcouldn't tell them from the real kind.I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.  He oftendone that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there withhis head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  Ididn't take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He wasthinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was lowand homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in hislife; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as whitefolks does for their'n.  It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged Iwas asleep, and saying, “Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it'smighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!”  Hewas a mighty good nigger, Jim was.But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and youngones; and by and by he says:“What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonderon de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de timeI treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery.  She warn't on'y 'bout fo' yearole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; butshe got well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, Isays:“'Shet de do'.'“She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me.  It make memad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:“'Doan' you hear me?  Shet de do'!'“She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up.  I was a-bilin'!  I says:“'I lay I _make_ you mine!'“En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'.Den I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en whenI come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin'mos' right in it, a-lookin' down and mournin', en de tears runnin' down. My, but I _wuz_ mad!  I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den--it was ado' dat open innerds--jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behinede chile, ker-BLAM!--en my lan', de chile never move'!  My breff mos'hop outer me; en I feel so--so--I doan' know HOW I feel.  I crope out,all a-tremblin', en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow, en poke myhead in behine de chile, sof' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW!jis' as loud as I could yell.  _She never budge!_  Oh, Huck, I bust outa-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say, 'Oh, de po' little thing! De Lord God Amighty fogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogivehisself as long's he live!'  Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumbdeef en dumb--en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!”"

    "text": "NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out inthe middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and theduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jimhe spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a fewhours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had tolay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left himall alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him allby himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runawaynigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to layroped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressedJim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and awhite horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paintand painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed ifhe warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke tookand wrote out a sign on a shingle so:Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or fivefoot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sightbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling allover every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himselffree and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hopout of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two likea wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and hewouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he wasdead, he looked considerable more than that.These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there wasso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybethe news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn't hit noproject that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'dlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put upsomething on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would dropover to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providenceto lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had allbought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'non, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king'sduds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I neverknowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he lookedlike the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take offhis new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grandand good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and Igot my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore awayup under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a coupleof hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:“Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.”I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then wentscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come toa nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing thesweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had acouple of big carpet-bags by him.“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher' you boundfor, young man?”“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”“Git aboard,” says the king.  “Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p youwith them bags.  Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus”--meaning me,I see.I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap wasmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd comedown the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now hewas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  Theyoung fellow says:“When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and hecome mighty near getting here in time.'  But then I says again, 'No, Ireckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.'  You_ain't_ him, are you?”“No, my name's Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ ElexanderBlodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants. But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arrivingin time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it--which I hope hehasn't.”“Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that allright; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn'tmind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anythingin this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothingelse all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boystogether--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's the deefand dumb one--William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter andGeorge were the only ones that come out here; George was the marriedbrother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William's theonly ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got herein time.”“Did anybody send 'em word?”“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Petersaid then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well thistime. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young tobe much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so hewas kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seemto care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--andWilliam, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can'tbear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'dtold in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of theproperty divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right--for Georgedidn't leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to puta pen to.”“Why do you reckon Harvey don't come?  Wher' does he live?”“Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn't ever been inthis country.  He hasn't had any too much time--and besides he mightn't agot the letter at all, you know.”“Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.You going to Orleans, you say?”“Yes, but that ain't only a part of it.  I'm going in a ship, nextWednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”“It's a pretty long journey.  But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.Is Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?”“Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's aboutfourteen--that's the one that gives herself to good works and has ahare-lip.”“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and theyain't going to let them come to no harm.  There's Hobson, the Babtis'preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and thewidow Bartley, and--well, there's a lot of them; but these are the onesthat Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, whenhe wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he getshere.”Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptiedthat young fellow.  Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody andeverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and aboutPeter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was acarpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and soon, and so on.  Then he says:“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”“Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stopthere.  When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boatwill, but this is a St. Louis one.”“Was Peter Wilks well off?”“Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it's reckoned heleft three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers.”“When did you say he died?”“I didn't say, but it was last night.”“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”“Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.”“Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time oranother. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.”“Yes, sir, it's the best way.  Ma used to always say that.”When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon shegot off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lostmy ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle upanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the newcarpet-bags.  And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there andgit him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  WhenI got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on alog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow hadsaid it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it hetried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, fora slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but hereally done it pretty good.  Then he says:“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deefand dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for asteamboat.About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last therewas a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we wentaboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wantedto go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, andsaid they wouldn't land us.  But the king was ca'm.  He says:“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on andput off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?”So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to thevillage they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down whenthey see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” theygive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,“What d' I tell you?”  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:“I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_live yesterday evening.”Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell upagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down hisback, and says:“Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,it's too, too hard!”Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs tothe duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag andbust out a-crying.  If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds,that ever I struck.Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said allsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hillfor them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all abouthis brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again onhis hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tannerlike they'd lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anythinglike it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the humanrace."

    "text": "THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the peopletearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting ontheir coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.  The windows anddooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:“Is it _them_?”And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:“You bet it is.”When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and thethree girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, butthat don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and herface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncleswas come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped forthem, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet againat last and have such good times.Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then helooked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; sothen him and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, andt'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybodydropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,people saying “Sh!” and all the men taking their hats off and droopingtheir heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got therethey bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and thenthey bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; andthen they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chinsover each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,I never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybodywas doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anythinglike it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t'other ont'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on thecoffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it cometo that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, andeverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying aword, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their handon their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears runningdown, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and givethe next woman a show.  I never see anything so disgusting.Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, andworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears andflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brotherto lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the longjourney of four thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened andsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so hethanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart, because outof their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all thatkind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbersout a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to cryingfit to bust.And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in thecrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all theirmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as churchletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter andhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest andbully.Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and hisnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of thefamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set upwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother layingyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names thatwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he willname the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and DeaconLot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, andDr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-huntingtogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'otherworld, and the preacher was pinting him right.  Lawyer Bell was away upto Louisville on business.  But the rest was on hand, and so they allcome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but justkept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilsthe made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo” all the time, like a baby that can't talk.So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about prettymuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sortsof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or toGeorge's family, or to Peter.  And he always let on that Peter wrote himthe things; but that was a lie:  he got every blessed one of them out ofthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and theking he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the dwelling-houseand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses andland (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in goldto Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid downcellar.  So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and haveeverything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bagthey spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all themyaller-boys.  My, the way the king's eyes did shine!  He slaps the dukeon the shoulder and says:“Oh, _this_ ain't bully nor noth'n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don't_ it?”The duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted themthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and theking says:“It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man andrepresentatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you andme, Bilge.  Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence.  It's the bestway, in the long run.  I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no betterway.”Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it ontrust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and it comes outfour hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the king:“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteendollars?”They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.  Thenthe duke says:“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckonthat's the way of it.  The best way's to let it go, and keep still aboutit.  We can spare it.”“Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.  I don't k'yer noth'n 'boutthat--it's the _count_ I'm thinkin' about.  We want to be awful squareand open and above-board here, you know.  We want to lug this h-yermoney up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther' ain't noth'nsuspicious.  But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, youknow, we don't want to--”“Hold on,” says the duke.  “Le's make up the deffisit,” and he begun tohaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.“It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin' cleverhead on you,” says the king.  “Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin'us out agin,” and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack themup.It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea.  Le's go up stairs and countthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.”“Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It's the most dazzling idea 'at ever aman struck.  You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see.Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it.  Let 'emfetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this 'll lay 'em out.”When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the kinghe counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twentyelegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked theirchops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king beginto swell himself up for another speech.  He says:“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous bythem that's left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous bythese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's leftfatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that hewould a done _more_ generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin'his dear William and me.  Now, _wouldn't_ he?  Ther' ain't no question'bout it in _my_ mind.  Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it bethat 'd stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o' uncles wouldit be that 'd rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he lovedso at sech a time?  If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I'lljest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs tothe duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid andleather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch hismeaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.  Then the king says,“I knowed it; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feelsabout it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it_all_.  It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.”Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for theduke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.  Andeverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook thehands off of them frauds, saying all the time:“You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!”Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseasedagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; andbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobodysaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they wasall busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he'dstarted in on--“--they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased.  That's why they'reinvited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten thathis funeral orgies sh'd be public.”And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, andevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the dukehe couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,“_Obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing andreaching it over people's heads to him.  The king he reads it and putsit in his pocket, and says:“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart's_ aluz right.  Asks meto invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make 'em allwelcome.  But he needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at.”Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in hisfuneral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.  Andwhen he done it the third time he says:“I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because itain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the rightterm. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out.  Wesay orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thingyou're after more exact.  It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, coverup; hence in_ter._  So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er publicfuneral.”He was the _worst_ I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he laughedright in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody says, “Why,_doctor_!” and Abner Shackleford says:“Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news?  This is Harvey Wilks.”The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:“Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician?  I--”“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor.  “_You_ talk like anEnglishman, _don't_ you?  It's the worst imitation I ever heard.  _You_Peter Wilks's brother!  You're a fraud, that's what you are!”Well, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor and tried toquiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'dshowed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurtHarvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that.  But itwarn't no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretendedto be an Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than whathe did was a fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the kingand crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.  Hesays:“I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as afriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out ofharm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothingto do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,as he calls it.  He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come herewith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, andyou take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by thesefoolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks, youknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.  Now listento me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it.  Will you?”Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!  Shesays:“_Here_ is my answer.”  She hove up the bag of money and put it in theking's hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest forme and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt forit.”Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and thehare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped their hands andstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up hishead and smiled proud.  The doctor says:“All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.  But I warn you all that atime 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of thisday.” And away he went.“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “we'll try andget 'em to send for you;” which made them all laugh, and they said itwas a prime good hit."

    "text": "WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was offfor spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do forUncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which wasa little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters andsleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which wasplain but nice.  She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other trapstook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he saidthey warn't.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them wasa curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was anold hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sortsof little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a roomwith.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter forthese fixings, and so don't disturb them.  The duke's room was prettysmall, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them,and the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head ofthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuitswas, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the friedchickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for toforce out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,and said so--said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and“Where, for the land's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickles?” andall that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at asupper, you know.And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchenoff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean upthe things.  The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blestif I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.  She says:“Did you ever see the king?”“Who?  William Fourth?  Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.”  Iknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.  So when I says hegoes to our church, she says:“What--regular?”“Yes--regular.  His pew's right over opposite ourn--on t'other side thepulpit.”“I thought he lived in London?”“Well, he does.  Where _would_ he live?”“But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?”I see I was up a stump.  I had to let on to get choked with a chickenbone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.  Then I says:“I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield.  That'sonly in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”“Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain't on the sea.”“Well, who said it was?”“Why, you did.”“I _didn't_ nuther.”“You did!”“I didn't.”“You did.”“I never said nothing of the kind.”“Well, what _did_ you say, then?”“Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that's what I said.”“Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on thesea?”“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”“Yes.”“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”“Why, no.”“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a seabath.”“How does he get it, then?”“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels.  Therein the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants his waterhot.  They can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.They haven't got no conveniences for it.”“Oh, I see, now.  You might a said that in the first place and savedtime.”When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I wascomfortable and glad.  Next, she says:“Do you go to church, too?”“Yes--regular.”“Where do you set?”“Why, in our pew.”“_Whose_ pew?”“Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey's.”“His'n?  What does _he_ want with a pew?”“Wants it to set in.  What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?”“Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit.”Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher.  I see I was up a stump again, so Iplayed another chicken bone and got another think.  Then I says:“Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?”“Why, what do they want with more?”“What!--to preach before a king?  I never did see such a girl as you.They don't have no less than seventeen.”“Seventeen!  My land!  Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as that,not if I _never_ got to glory.  It must take 'em a week.”“Shucks, they don't _all_ of 'em preach the same day--only _one_ of 'em.”“Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?”“Oh, nothing much.  Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing oranother.  But mainly they don't do nothing.”“Well, then, what are they _for_?”“Why, they're for _style_.  Don't you know nothing?”“Well, I don't _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.  How isservants treated in England?  Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat ourniggers?”“_No_!  A servant ain't nobody there.  They treat them worse than dogs.”“Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year'sweek, and Fourth of July?”“Oh, just listen!  A body could tell _you_ hain't ever been to Englandby that.  Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year'send to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor niggershows, nor nowheres.”“Nor church?”“Nor church.”“But _you_ always went to church.”Well, I was gone up again.  I forgot I was the old man's servant.  Butnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley wasdifferent from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether hewanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being thelaw.  But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see shewarn't satisfied.  She says:“Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?”“Honest injun,” says I.“None of it at all?”“None of it at all.  Not a lie in it,” says I.“Lay your hand on this book and say it.”I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it andsaid it.  So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:“Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'llbelieve the rest.”“What is it you won't believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane, stepping in withSusan behind her.  “It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him,and him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to betreated so?”“That's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody beforethey're hurt.  I hain't done nothing to him.  He's told some stretchers,I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bitand grain I _did_ say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,can't he?”“I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here inour house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it.  If youwas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't tosay a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.”“Why, Mam, he said--”“It don't make no difference what he _said_--that ain't the thing.  Thething is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to makehim remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks.”I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile robher of her money!Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did giveHare-lip hark from the tomb!Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob herof her money!Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovelyagain--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardlyanything left o' poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.”She done it, too; and she done it beautiful.  She done it so beautifulit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, soshe could do it again.I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her ofher money.  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselvesout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.  I felt soornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;I'll hive that money for them or bust.So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  WhenI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--thatwon't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke wouldmake it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--Idasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got themoney, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.  If she was tofetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,I judge.  No; there ain't no good way but one.  I got to steal thatmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicionthat I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-goingto leave till they've played this family and this town for all they'reworth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; andby and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tellMary Jane where it's hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; hemight scare them out of here yet.So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall wasdark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it withmy hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to letanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went tohis room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn't do nothingwithout a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course.  So I judged I'dgot to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that timeI hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; Ireached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touchedthe curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that andsnuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was toget down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn't found the bedwhen I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide underthe bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, andthe king says:“Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin' short, because it's better forus to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em achance to talk us over.”“Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable.  Thatdoctor lays on my mind.  I wanted to know your plans.  I've got anotion, and I think it's a sound one.”“What is it, duke?”“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clipit down the river with what we've got.  Specially, seeing we got it soeasy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when ofcourse we allowed to have to steal it back.  I'm for knocking off andlighting out.”That made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a beena little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, Theking rips out and says:“What!  And not sell out the rest o' the property?  March off likea passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good,salable stuff, too.”The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn'twant to go no deeper--didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_they had.“Why, how you talk!” says the king.  “We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing atall but jest this money.  The people that _buys_ the property is thesuff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--whichwon't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll allgo back to the estate.  These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin,and that's enough for _them_; they're young and spry, and k'n easyearn a livin'.  _they_ ain't a-goin to suffer.  Why, jest think--there'sthous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off.  Bless you, _they_ain't got noth'n' to complain of.”Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said allright, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and thatdoctor hanging over them.  But the king says:“Cuss the doctor!  What do we k'yer for _him_?  Hain't we got all thefools in town on our side?  And ain't that a big enough majority in anytown?”So they got ready to go down stairs again.  The duke says:“I don't think we put that money in a good place.”That cheered me up.  I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint ofno kind to help me.  The king says:“Why?”“Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you knowthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these dudsup and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money andnot borrow some of it?”“Your head's level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumblingunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was.  I stuck tight tothe wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what themfellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think whatI'd better do if they did catch me.  But the king he got the bag beforeI could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicionedI was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the strawtick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or twoamongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger onlymakes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only abouttwice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.But I knowed better.  I had it out of there before they was half-waydown stairs.  I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till Icould get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outsideof the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give thehouse a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wantedto, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.  By and by Iheard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laidwith my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything wasgoing to happen.  But nothing did.So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn'tbegun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder."

    "text": "I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoedalong, and got down stairs all right.  There warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men thatwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The doorwas open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was acandle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; butI see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so Ishoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  Irun in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place Isee to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along abouta foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth overit, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, justdown beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they wasso cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.The person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, andkneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I seeshe begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.  Islid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure themwatchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everythingwas all right.  They hadn't stirred.I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thingplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so muchresk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; becausewhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back toMary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't thething that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, themoney 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybodyanother chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slidedown and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it.  Every minute it wasgetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would beginto stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in myhands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of.  I don't wish to bemixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and thewatchers was gone.  There warn't nobody around but the family and thewidow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anythinghad been happening, but I couldn't tell.Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and theyset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and thenset all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors tillthe hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffinlid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, withfolks around.Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls tookseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hourthe people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at thedead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it wasall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holdinghandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing alittle.  There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet onthe floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at afuneral than they do at other places except church.When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in hisblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the lasttouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved peoplearound, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and doneit with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place overagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I eversee; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was readya young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky andcolicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only onethat had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobsonopened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the mostoutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was onlyone dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up rightalong; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--youcouldn't hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobodydidn't seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see thatlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,“Don't you worry--just depend on me.”  Then he stooped down and begunto glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people'sheads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more andmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around twosides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two secondswe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl ortwo, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemntalk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker'sback and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided andglided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded hismouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_Hehad a rat_!”  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again tohis place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,because naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don'tcost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to belooked up to and liked.  There warn't no more popular man in town thanwhat that undertaker was.Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; andthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, andat last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on thecoffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched himpretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along assoft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  Ididn't know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s'posesomebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whetherto write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't findnothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might gethunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write atall; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened ita hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetchthe whole business!They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching facesagain--I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy.  But nothing come ofit; the faces didn't tell me nothing.The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that hiscongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he musthurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He wasvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he couldstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done.  And hesaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them; andthat pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixedand amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickledthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and toldhim to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Thempoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see themgetting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me tochip in and change the general tune.Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and allthe property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joygot the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the kingsold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they calledit, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and theirmother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and themniggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around eachother, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girlssaid they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or soldaway from the town.  I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight ofthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necksand crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a hadto bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't noaccount and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come outflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and thechildren that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool hebulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tellyou the duke was powerful uneasy.Next day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king andthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their lookthat there was trouble.  The king says:“Was you in my room night before last?”“No, your majesty”--which was the way I always called him when nobody butour gang warn't around.“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”“No, your majesty.”“Honor bright, now--no lies.”“Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth.  I hain't beena-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showedit to you.”The duke says:“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”“Stop and think.”I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't everexpected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:“What, all of them?”“No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't think I ever see themall come _out_ at once but just one time.”“Hello!  When was that?”“It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn't early,because I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I seethem.”“Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How'd they act?”“They didn't do nothing.  And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as Isee. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved inthere to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up;and found you _warn't_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of theway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked youup.”“Great guns, _this_ is a go!” says the king; and both of them lookedpretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking andscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of alittle raspy chuckle, and says:“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let onto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don't ever tell _me_any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent.  Why, the waythey played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there'sa fortune in 'em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want abetter lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ thatsong--that draft?”“In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?”“Well, _that's_ all right then, thank goodness.”Says I, kind of timid-like:“Is something gone wrong?”The king whirls on me and rips out:“None o' your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y'r ownaffairs--if you got any.  Long as you're in this town don't you forgit_that_--you hear?”  Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller itand say noth'n':  mum's the word for _us_.”As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, andsays:“Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It's a good business--yes.”The king snarls around on him and says:“I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick.  If theprofits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none tocarry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?”“Well, _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a gotmy advice listened to.”The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swappedaround and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for notcoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room actingthat way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And thenwaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him notlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd beblamed if he'd ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I feltdreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn'tdone the niggers no harm by it."

    "text": "BY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and startedfor down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, andI see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'dbeen packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But shehad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in herhands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  Iwent in there and says:“Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and Ican't--most always.  Tell me about it.”So she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She saidthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn'tknow _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother andthe children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then bustedout bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't _ever_ going to see each other anymore!”“But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!” says I.Laws, it was out before I could think!  And before I could budge shethrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it_again_, say it _again_!I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a closeplace. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, veryimpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy andeased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.  So I went tostudying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tellsthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but itlooks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if itdon't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it'sso kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, Isays to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell thetruth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag ofpowder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where youcould go and stay three or four days?”“Yes; Mr. Lothrop's.  Why?”“Never mind why yet.  If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will seeeach other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ howI know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?”“Four days!” she says; “I'll stay a year!”“All right,” I says, “I don't want nothing more out of _you_ than justyour word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.”  Shesmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don't mind it,I'll shut the door--and bolt it.”Then I come back and set down again, and says:“Don't you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got totell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's abad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help forit.  These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple offrauds--regular dead-beats.  There, now we're over the worst of it, youcan stand the rest middling easy.”It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoalwater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higherall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struckthat young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where sheflung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissedher sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her faceafire like sunset, and says:“The brute!  Come, don't waste a minute--not a _second_--we'll have themtarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”Says I:“Cert'nly.  But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or--”“Oh,” she says, “what am I _thinking_ about!” she says, and set rightdown again.  “Don't mind what I said--please don't--you _won't,_ now,_will_ you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way thatI said I would die first.  “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” shesays; “now go on, and I won't do so any more.  You tell me what to do,and whatever you say I'll do it.”“Well,” I says, “it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed soI got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--Idruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town wouldget me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be anotherperson that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble.  Well, wegot to save _him_, hain't we?  Of course.  Well, then, we won't blow onthem.”Saying them words put a good idea in my head.  I see how maybe I couldget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboardto answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin workingtill pretty late to-night.  I says:“Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stayat Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther.  How fur is it?”“A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.”“Well, that 'll answer.  Now you go along out there, and lay lowtill nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you homeagain--tell them you've thought of something.  If you get here beforeeleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait _till_eleven, and _then_ if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of theway, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and getthese beats jailed.”“Good,” she says, “I'll do it.”“And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up alongwith them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,and you must stand by me all you can.”“Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she saidit, too.“If I get away I sha'n't be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallionsain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I _was_ here.  I could swearthey was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they'repeople that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be.  I'll tell youhow to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--'RoyalNonesuch, Bricksville.'  Put it away, and don't lose it.  When thecourt wants to find out something about these two, let them send up toBricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,and ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down herebefore you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they'll come a-biling, too.”I judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:“Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry.  Nobody don'thave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auctionon accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this tillthey get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going tocount, and they ain't going to get no money.  It's just like the wayit was with the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will beback before long.  Why, they can't collect the money for the _niggers_yet--they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”“Well,” she says, “I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll startstraight for Mr. Lothrop's.”“'Deed, _that_ ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “by no mannerof means; go _before_ breakfast.”“Why?”“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”“Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know.  What was it?”“Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people.  I don'twant no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down andread it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face youruncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--”“There, there, don't!  Yes, I'll go before breakfast--I'll be glad to.And leave my sisters with them?”“Yes; never mind about them.  They've got to stand it yet a while.  Theymight suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don't want you tosee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor wasto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all ofthem. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and sayyou've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, orto see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning.”“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given tothem.”“Well, then, it sha'n't be.”  It was well enough to tell _her_ so--noharm in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it'sthe little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below;it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.  ThenI says:  “There's one more thing--that bag of money.”“Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think_how_ they got it.”“No, you're out, there.  They hain't got it.”“Why, who's got it?”“I wish I knowed, but I don't.  I _had_ it, because I stole it fromthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'mafraid it ain't there no more.  I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'mjust as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  Icome nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place Icome to, and run--and it warn't a good place.”“Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allowit--you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault.  Where did you hide it?”I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and Icouldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see thatcorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  Sofor a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:“I'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don'tmind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, andyou can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to.  Do youreckon that 'll do?”“Oh, yes.”So I wrote:  “I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you wascrying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I wasmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all byherself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her ownroof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give itto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by thehand, hard, and says:“_Good_-bye.  I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and ifI don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think ofyou a many and a many a time, and I'll _pray_ for you, too!”--and she wasgone.Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was morenearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just thatkind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--therewarn't no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, butin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; inmy opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but itain't no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--shelays over them all.  I hain't ever seen her since that time that I seeher go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckonI've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her sayingshe would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any goodfor me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody seeher go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:“What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river thatyou all goes to see sometimes?”They says:“There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly.”“That's the name,” I says; “I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane shetold me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one ofthem's sick.”“Which one?”“I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--”“Sakes alive, I hope it ain't _Hanner_?”“I'm sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner's the very one.”“My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?”“It ain't no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss MaryJane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours.”“Only think of that, now!  What's the matter with her?”I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:“Mumps.”“Mumps your granny!  They don't set up with people that's got themumps.”“They don't, don't they?  You better bet they do with _these_ mumps. These mumps is different.  It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”“How's it a new kind?”“Because it's mixed up with other things.”“What other things?”“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, andyaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all.”“My land!  And they call it the _mumps_?”“That's what Miss Mary Jane said.”“Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?”“Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That's what it starts with.”“Well, ther' ain't no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and takepison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brainsout, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskullup and say, 'Why, he stumped his _toe_.'  Would ther' be any sensein that? _No_.  And ther' ain't no sense in _this_, nuther.  Is itketching?”“Is it _ketching_?  Why, how you talk.  Is a _harrow_ catching--in thedark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another,ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching thewhole harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of aharrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, youcome to get it hitched on good.”“Well, it's awful, I think,” says the hare-lip.  “I'll go to UncleHarvey and--”“Oh, yes,” I says, “I _would_.  Of _course_ I would.  I wouldn't lose notime.”“Well, why wouldn't you?”“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain't your unclesobleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do youreckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all thatjourney by yourselves?  _you_ know they'll wait for you.  So fur, sogood. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he?  Very well, then; is a_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceivea _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now_you_ know he ain't.  What _will_ he do, then?  Why, he'll say, 'It's agreat pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way theycan; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three monthsit takes to show on her if she's got it.'  But never mind, if you thinkit's best to tell your uncle Harvey--”“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having goodtimes in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane'sgot it or not?  Why, you talk like a muggins.”“Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors.”“Listen at that, now.  You do beat all for natural stupidness.  Can'tyou _see_ that _they'd_ go and tell?  Ther' ain't no way but just to nottell anybody at _all_.”“Well, maybe you're right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.”“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?”“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, 'Tell them togive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run overthe river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family youruncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--”“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?”“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem toremember them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has runover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buythis house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they hadit than anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they saythey'll come, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; andif she is, she'll be home in the morning anyway.  She said, don't saynothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll beperfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buyingthe house; I know it, because she told me so herself.”“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, andgive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.Everything was all right now.  The girls wouldn't say nothing becausethey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would rutherMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach ofDoctor Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--Ireckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself.  Of course hewould a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, notbeing brung up to it.Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the endof the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old manhe was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of theauctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a littlegoody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooingfor sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything wassold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  Sothey'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king wasfor wanting to swallow _everything_.  Well, whilst they was at it asteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whoopingand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:“_Here's_ your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to oldPeter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!”"

    "text": "THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and anice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn't see nojoke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king someto see any.  I reckoned they'd turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, butjust went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that'sgoogling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazeddown sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache inhis very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in theworld.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal peoplegethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That oldgentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Prettysoon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ anEnglishman--not the king's way, though the king's _was_ pretty good foran imitation.  I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitatehim; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:“This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'llacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it andanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke hisarm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in thenight by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is hisbrother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs toamount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with.  We arewho we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I canprove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hoteland wait.”So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, andblethers out:“Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how.  Losttheir baggage! That's _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the_circumstances_!”So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,or maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one wasa sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kindmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat andwas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now andthen and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was goneup to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come alongand listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to theking now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to thistown?”“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.“But what time o' day?”“In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown.”“_How'd_ you come?”“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”“Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_'--in acanoe?”“I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.”“It's a lie.”Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to anold man and a preacher.“Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pintthat mornin'.  I live up there, don't I?  Well, I was up there, andhe was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with TimCollins and a boy.”The doctor he up and says:“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”“I reckon I would, but I don't know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I knowhim perfectly easy.”It was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:“Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if_these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.  I think it's ourduty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked intothis thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We'll takethese fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and Ireckon we'll find out _something_ before we get through.”It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; sowe all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along bythe hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, andfetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:“I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they'refrauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about. If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold PeterWilks left?  It ain't unlikely.  If these men ain't frauds, they won'tobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they provethey're all right--ain't that so?”Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a prettytight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only lookedsorrowful, and says:“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no dispositionto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigationo' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n sendand see, if you want to.”“Where is it, then?”“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid itinside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the fewdays we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went downstairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they gotclean away with it.  My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.”The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn't altogetherbelieve him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I saidno, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and Inever thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked upmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:“Are _you_ English, too?”I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we hadit, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word aboutsupper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, andkept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  Theymade the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that theold gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and bythey had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handedlook out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on theright side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get prettyfur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:“Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckonyou ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want ispractice.  You do it pretty awkward.”I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,anyway.The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:“If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in andreached out his hand, and says:“Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so oftenabout?”The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and lookedpleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one sideand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:“That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with yourbrother's, and then they'll know it's all right.”So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twistedhis head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time theduke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyerturns to the new old gentleman and says:“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it.  The lawyer lookedpowerful astonished, and says:“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn'twrite them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tellyou, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here's _this_ oldgentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn'twrite them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ atall.  Now, here's some letters from--”The new old gentleman says:“If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brotherthere--so he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.”“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.  I've got someof William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so wecan com--”“He _can't_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If hecould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own lettersand mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.”The lawyer done it, and says:“I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap strongerresemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  Ithought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'emWilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said hisbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't triedto write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minutehe put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling andwarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he wassaying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:“I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to layout my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.”Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd asqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it tookhim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to makemost _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without anynotice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still inthere, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  SaysI to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use. Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckonhe thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, sothey'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:“Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'ntell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, bluearrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it. _now_ what do you say--hey?”Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-outcheek.The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, andhis eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, andsays:“There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on PeterWilks' breast?”Both of them spoke up and says:“We didn't see no such mark.”“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breastwas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he wasyoung), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W”--and he markedthem that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain't that what you saw?”Both of them spoke up again, and says:“No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.”Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:“The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!le's ride 'em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and therewas a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,and says:“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you_please_!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.”That took them.“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyerand the doctor sung out:“Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch_them_ along, too!”“We'll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don't find them marks we'lllynch the whole gang!”I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, youknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for thegraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the wholetown at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in theevening.As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, andblow on our dead-beats.Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on likewildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and thelightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongstthe leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I everwas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different fromwhat I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own timeif I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back tosave me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in theworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If theydidn't find them--I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't thinkabout nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautifultime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by thewrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  Hedragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over itlike an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they hadabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn'tthought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by theflicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half amile off, to borrow one.So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rainstarted, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning comebrisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never tookno notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minuteyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and theshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second thedark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and thensuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, toscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, itwas awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited andpanting.All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,and somebody sings out:“By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!”Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist andgive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I litout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it allto myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and thebuzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting ofthe thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, soI never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through themain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye andset it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry anddisappointed, I didn't know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled upsudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behindme in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in thisworld. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make thetowhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the firsttime the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it andshoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in themiddle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck theraft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gaspif I could afforded it.  But I didn't.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we're shutof them!”Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was sofull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot upin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old KingLear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers andlights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me andbless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of theking and the duke, but I says:“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose andlet her slide!”So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, andnobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crackmy heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crackI noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath andlistened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted outover the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars andmaking their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it wasall I could do to keep from crying."

    "text": "WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,and says:“Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,hey?”I says:“No, your majesty, we warn't--_please_ don't, your majesty!”“Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I'll shake theinsides out o' you!”“Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty. The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying hehad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorryto see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took bysurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets goof me and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I litout.  It didn't seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn't do nothing,and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stoppedrunning till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and theduke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and wasawful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't.”Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,yes, it's _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckonedhe'd drownd me.  But the duke says:“Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Didyou inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don't remember it.”So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody init. But the duke says:“You better a blame' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you'rethe one that's entitled to it most.  You hain't done a thing from thestart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheekywith that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was rightdown bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn't beenfor that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come--andthen--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to thegraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if theexcited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get alook we'd a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,too--longer than _we'd_ need 'em.”They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind ofabsent-minded like:“Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!”That made me squirm!“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_we_did.”After about a half a minute the king drawls out:“Leastways, I did.”The duke says, the same way:“On the contrary, I did.”The king kind of ruffles up, and says:“Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?”The duke says, pretty brisk:“When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was _you_referring to?”“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don't know--maybe you wasasleep, and didn't know what you was about.”The duke bristles up now, and says:“Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?”“_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!”“It's a lie!”--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:“Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!”The duke says:“Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and digit up, and have it all to yourself.”“Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, andtake back everything I said.”“You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't.  There, now!”“Well, then, I b'lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now_don't_ git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money andhide it?”The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:“Well, I don't care if I _did_, I didn't _do_ it, anyway.  But you notonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.”“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest.  I won't sayI warn't goin' to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got inahead o' me.”“It's a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--”The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:“'Nough!--I _own up!_”I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easierthan what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off andsays:“If you ever deny it again I'll drown you.  It's _well_ for you to setthere and blubber like a baby--it's fitten for you, after the wayyou've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobbleeverything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my ownfather.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear itsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_that rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to makeup the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuchand one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!”The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me.”“Dry up!  I don't want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke.  “And_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They've got all their own money back,and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G'long to bed, anddon't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long 's _you_ live!”So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half anhour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got thelovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms.  Theyboth got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellowenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bagagain.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they gotto snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything."

    "text": "WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right alongdown the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mightylong ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss onthem, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was thefirst I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn anddismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and theybegun to work the villages again.First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enoughfor them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they starteda dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than akangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumpedin and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go atyellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up andgive them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackledmissionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, anda little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.  So atlast they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as shefloated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by thehalf a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together inthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.Jim and me got uneasy.  We didn't like the look of it.  We judged theywas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned itover and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to breakinto somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-moneybusiness, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up anagreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with suchactions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the coldshake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning wehid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit ofa shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and toldus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to seeif anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (“House torob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing ityou'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and theraft--and you'll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said if hewarn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, andwe was to come along.So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, andwas in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn'tseem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.Something was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday comeand no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_change on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, andhunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in theback room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafersbullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with allhis might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing tothem.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the kingbegun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out andshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road likea deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be along day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there allout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:“Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!”But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim wasgone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and runthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn'tno use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn't helpit. But I couldn't set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, andasked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:“Yes.”“Whereabouts?” says I.“Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here.  He's a runawaynigger, and they've got him.  Was you looking for him?”“You bet I ain't!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or twoago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to laydown and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeardto come out.”“Well,” he says, “you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.He run off f'm down South, som'ers.”“It's a good job they got him.”“Well, I _reckon_!  There's two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It'slike picking up money out'n the road.”“Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him_first_. Who nailed him?”“It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him forforty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.  Thinko' that, now!  You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven year.”“That's me, every time,” says I.  “But maybe his chance ain't worthno more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there's somethingain't straight about it.”“But it _is_, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tellsthe plantation he's frum, below Newr_leans_.  No-sirree-_bob_, theyain't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme achaw tobacker, won't ye?”I didn't have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in thewigwam to think.  But I couldn't come to nothing.  I thought till I woremy head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.  After allthis long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here itwas all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, becausethey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and makehim a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for fortydirty dollars.Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim tobe a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be aslave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him totell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for twothings: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulnessfor leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery anddisgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that HuckFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to seeanybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his bootsfor shame.  That's just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, andthen he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as hecan hide it, it ain't no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more Istudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and themore wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, whenit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providenceslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was beingwatched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing apoor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now wasshowing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-goingto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best Icould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brungup wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of mekept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; andif you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts asI'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if Icouldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  SoI kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why wouldn't they?  Itwarn't no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  Iknowed very well why they wouldn't come.  It was because my heart warn'tright; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playingdouble.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I washolding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and writeto that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me Iknowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a lie--I foundthat out.So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what todo. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--andthen see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt aslight as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So Igot a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set downand wrote:Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile belowPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for thereward if you send._Huck Finn._I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had everfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do itstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinkinghow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lostand going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over ourtrip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the dayand in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and wea-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow Icouldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only theother kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead ofcalling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was whenI come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always callme honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and howgood he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by tellingthe men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I wasthe best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he'sgot now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I wasa-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, andI knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and thensays to myself:“All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I letthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved thewhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  Andfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because aslong as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over someconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan thatsuited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was downthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with myraft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept thenight through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing oranother in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landedbelow where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her andsunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarterof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign onit, “Phelps's Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two orthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn'tsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get thelay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there fromthe village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there wasthe duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-nightperformance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  Iwas right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:“Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?”  Then he says, kind of glad andeager, “Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?”I says:“Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.”Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I saysto myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I wenta-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offeredme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetcha sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove himalong, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we afterhim.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over thecountry till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then wefetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there andsee it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had toleave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got inthe world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no propertyno more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down andcried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of theraft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”“Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool hadmade a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggerythe loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent butwhat he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night andfound the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft andshook us, and run off down the river.'”“I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in theworld, and the only property.”“We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had troubleenough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch anothershake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where'sthat ten cents? Give it here.”I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him tospend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all themoney I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He neversaid nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he donethat!”“How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?”“No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money'sgone.”“_Sold_ him?”  I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, andthat was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.”“Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up yourblubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyesbefore. I went on a-whimpering, and says:“I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.I got to turn out and find my nigger.”He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering onhis arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:“I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'llpromise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell youwhere to find him.”So I promised, and he says:“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped.  You see, hestarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun tostudy and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so hewas. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out ofthe way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and helives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start thisvery afternoon.”“No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue inyour head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with_us_, d'ye hear?”That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  Iwanted to be left free to work my plans.“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you wantto. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--someidiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such downSouth here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was forgetting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; butmind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but Ikinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him outat that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile beforeI stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  Ireckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without foolingaround, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows couldget away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all Iwanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them."

    "text": "WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faintdronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome andlike everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quiversthe leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it'sspirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and youalways think they're talking about _you_.  As a general thing it makes abody wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and theyall look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made outof logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a differentlength, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on whenthey are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in thebig yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with thenap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripesbeen whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a bigbroad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-houseback of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'otherside the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down againstthe back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench bythe kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep therein the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees awayoff in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one placeby the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; thenthe cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, andstarted for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim humof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ thelonesomest sound in the whole world.I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trustingto Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; forI'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouthif I left it alone.When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and wentfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  Andsuch another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kindof a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle offifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and nosesstretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; youcould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in herhand, singing out, “Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!” and shefetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain'tno harm in a hound, nohow.And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little niggerboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to theirmother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the waythey always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stickin her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting thesame way the little niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so shecould hardly stand--and says:“It's _you_, at last!--_ain't_ it?”I out with a “Yes'm” before I thought.She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both handsand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “Youdon't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but lawsakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, itdoes seem like I could eat you up!  Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tellhim howdy.”But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, andhid behind her.  So she run on:“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you getyour breakfast on the boat?”I said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we gotthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down ona little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:“Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungryfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's comeat last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep'you?--boat get aground?”“Yes'm--she--”“Don't say yes'm--say Aunt Sally.  Where'd she get aground?”I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether theboat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal oninstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towardsOrleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the namesof bars down that way.  I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget thename of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetchedit out:“It warn't the grounding--that didn't keep us back but a little.  Weblowed out a cylinder-head.”“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”“No'm.  Killed a nigger.”“Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years agolast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the oldLally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  AndI think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knoweda family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, Iremember now, he _did_ die.  Mortification set in, and they had toamputate him. But it didn't save him.  Yes, it was mortification--thatwas it.  He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a gloriousresurrection. They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle's been upto the town every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n anhour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,didn't you?--oldish man, with a--”“No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the townand out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here toosoon; and so I come down the back way.”“Who'd you give the baggage to?”“Nobody.”“Why, child, it 'll be stole!”“Not where I hid it I reckon it won't,” I says.“How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”It was kinder thin ice, but I says:“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have somethingto eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'lunch, and give me all I wanted.”I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good.  I had my mind on thechildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pumpthem a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.Phelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chillsstreak all down my back, because she says:“But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a wordabout Sis, nor any of them.  Now I'll rest my works a little, and youstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about 'm all everyone of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they toldyou to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.”Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood byme this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see itwarn't a bit of use to try to go ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand.  SoI says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behindthe bed, and says:“Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that'll do; you can'tbe seen now.  Don't you let on you're here.  I'll play a joke on him.Children, don't you say a word.”I see I was in a fix now.  But it warn't no use to worry; there warn'tnothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand fromunder when the lightning struck.I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; thenthe bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:“Has he come?”“No,” says her husband.“Good-_ness_ gracious!” she says, “what in the warld can have become ofhim?”“I can't imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I must say it makes medreadful uneasy.”“Uneasy!” she says; “I'm ready to go distracted!  He _must_ a come; andyou've missed him along the road.  I _know_ it's so--something tells meso.”“Why, Sally, I _couldn't_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.”“But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!  He must a come!  You must amissed him.  He--”“Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.  I don't knowwhat in the world to make of it.  I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mindacknowledging 't I'm right down scared.  But there's no hope that he'scome; for he _couldn't_ come and me miss him.  Sally, it's terrible--justterrible--something's happened to the boat, sure!”“Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain't that somebody coming?”He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.Phelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of thebed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from thewindow there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, andI standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared,and says:“Why, who's that?”“Who do you reckon 't is?”“I hain't no idea.  Who _is_ it?”“It's _Tom Sawyer!_”By jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn't no time toswap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept onshaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh andcry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,and the rest of the tribe.But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was likebeing born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they frozeto me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn'thardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean theSawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And Iexplained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth ofWhite River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn't know but what it would takethree days to fix it.  If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a donejust as well.Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and prettyuncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy andcomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear asteamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s'poseTom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s'pose he steps in here anyminute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keepquiet?Well, I couldn't _have_ it that way; it wouldn't do at all.  I must goup the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would goup to the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was forgoing along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, andI druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me."

It's wonderful.  Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for thathorse now--I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before,and thought 'twas all she was worth.”That's all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he wasa preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of theplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a churchand schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it wasworth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, anddone the same way, down South.In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and AuntSally she see it through the window, because it was only about fiftyyards, and says:“Why, there's somebody come!  I wonder who 'tis?  Why, I do believe it'sa stranger.  Jimmy” (that's one of the children) “run and tell Lize toput on another plate for dinner.”Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a strangerdon't come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, forinterest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting forthe house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and wewas all bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and anaudience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstancesit warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that wassuitable.  He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,he come ca'm and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us helifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a boxthat had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them,and says:“Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?”“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I'm sorry to say 't your driverhas deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more.Come in, come in.”Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late--he's outof sight.”“Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner withus; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's.”“Oh, I _can't_ make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it.  I'llwalk--I don't mind the distance.”“But we won't _let_ you walk--it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to doit. Come right in.”“Oh, _do_,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not abit in the world.  You must stay.  It's a long, dusty three mile, andwe can't let you walk.  And, besides, I've already told 'em to put onanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us.  Comeright in and make yourself at home.”So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself bepersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a strangerfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he madeanother bow.Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville andeverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, andwondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on themouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and wasgoing on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back ofher hand, and says:“You owdacious puppy!”He looked kind of hurt, and says:“I'm surprised at you, m'am.”“You're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I've a good notion to takeand--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”He looked kind of humble, and says:“I didn't mean nothing, m'am.  I didn't mean no harm.  I--I--thought you'dlike it.”“Why, you born fool!”  She took up the spinning stick, and it lookedlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. “What made you think I'd like it?”“Well, I don't know.  Only, they--they--told me you would.”“_They_ told you I would.  Whoever told you's _another_ lunatic.  Inever heard the beat of it.  Who's _they_?”“Why, everybody.  They all said so, m'am.”It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and herfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:“Who's 'everybody'?  Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiotshort.”He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:“I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it.  They told me to.  They all toldme to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.  They all saidit--every one of them.  But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more--Iwon't, honest.”“You won't, won't you?  Well, I sh'd _reckon_ you won't!”“No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again--till you ask me.”“Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I askyou--or the likes of you.”“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so.  I can't make it out, somehow.They said you would, and I thought you would.  But--” He stopped andlooked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eyesomewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, “Didn't_you_ think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?”“Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.”Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:“Tom, didn't _you_ think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'SidSawyer--'”“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you impudentyoung rascal, to fool a body so--” and was going to hug him, but hefended her off, and says:“No, not till you've asked me first.”So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissedhim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and hetook what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn't looking for _you_at all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming buthim.”“It's because it warn't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,” hesays; “but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let mecome, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be afirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for meto by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But itwas a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain't no healthy place for a strangerto come.”“No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; Ihain't been so put out since I don't know when.  But I don't care, Idon't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes tohave you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don't deny it, Iwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house andthe kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for sevenfamilies--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laidin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk ofold cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty longblessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times. There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and meand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, theydidn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraidto try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the littleboys says:“Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain't going to be any; and youcouldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton andme all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell thepeople; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of townbefore this time.”So there it was!--but I couldn't help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in thesame room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up tobed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down thelightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody wasgoing to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry upand give them one they'd get into trouble sure.On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, andwhat a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about ourRoyal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I hadtime to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle ofit--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush ofpeople with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tinpans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of arail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they wasall over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in theworld that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous bigsoldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry forthem poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel anyhardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing tosee.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglersabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking veryinnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in themiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, andthe house rose up and went for them.So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I wasbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--thoughI hadn't done nothing.  But that's always the way; it don't make nodifference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain'tgot no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog thatdidn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yetain't no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same."

    "text": "WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet Iknow where Jim is.”“No!  Where?”“In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was atdinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”“Yes.”“What did you think the vittles was for?”“For a dog.”“So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.”“Why?”“Because part of it was watermelon.”“So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thoughtabout a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see anddon't see at the same time.”“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked itagain when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got upfrom table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,and where the people's all so kind and good.  Jim's the prisoner.  Allright--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucksfor any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan tosteal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we likethe best.”What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer's head Iwouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clownin a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the rightplan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:“Ready?”“Yes,” I says.“All right--bring it out.”“My plan is this,” I says.  “We can easy find out if it's Jim in there.Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from theisland.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of theold man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the riveron the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me andJim used to do before.  Wouldn't that plan work?”“_Work_?  Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it'stoo blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it.  What's the good of aplan that ain't no more trouble than that?  It's as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soapfactory.”I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; butI knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn'thave none of them objections to it.And it didn't.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it wasworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a manas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,and said we would waltz in on it.  I needn't tell what it was here,because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would bechanging it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in newbullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was inearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.That was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that wasrespectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks athome that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; andknowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop tothis business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,before everybody.  I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all.  It wasoutrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so behis true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and savehimself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:“Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know what I'mabout?”“Yes.”“Didn't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?”“Yes.”“_Well_, then.”That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use to say anymore; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it.  But Icouldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I justlet it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to haveit so, I couldn't help it.When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down tothe hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yardso as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn't makeno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes byin the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front andthe two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was thenorth side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with justone stout board nailed across it.  I says:“Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if wewrench off the board.”Tom says:“It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy asplaying hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little morecomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”“Well, then,” I says, “how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I donebefore I was murdered that time?”“That's more _like_,” he says.  “It's real mysterious, and troublesome,and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long. There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.”Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to thatjoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as longas the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was atthe south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle andsearched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connectionwith it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it butsome old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, andthe door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;“Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!”Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only haveto pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but thatwarn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he mustclimb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about threetimes, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time mostbusted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after hewas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and thistime he made the trip.In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabinsto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting throughbreakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling upa tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others wasleaving, the key come from the house.This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool wasall tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witchesoff.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, andmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds ofstrange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched solong before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on soabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do. So Tom says:“What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?”The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when youheave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at'im?”“Yes.”I hunched Tom, and whispers:“You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn't the plan.”“No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.”So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.  When we got inwe couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sureenough, and could see us; and he sings out:“Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?”I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't knownothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that niggerbusted in and says:“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady andkind of wondering, and says:“Does _who_ know us?”“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”“I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”“What _put_ it dar?  Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowedyou?”Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:“Well, that's mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out? _what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:“No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.”Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,and says:“Did you sing out?”“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain't said nothing, sah.”“Not a word?”“No, sah, I hain't said a word.”“Did you ever see us before?”“No, sah; not as I knows on.”So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, andsays, kind of severe:“What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?  What made you thinksomebody sung out?”“Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so. Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scoleme; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches.  I jis' wish to goodness he washeah now--_den_ what would he say!  I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way togit aroun' it _dis_ time.  But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's _sot_,stays sot; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, enwhen _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you.”Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him tobuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, andsays:“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was tocatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't givehim up, I'd hang him.”  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door tolook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jimand says:“Don't ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going onnights, it's us; we're going to set you free.”Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the niggercome back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wantedus to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because thewitches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folksaround then."

    "text": "IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck downinto the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see howto dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's calledfox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in adark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set downto rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be awatchman.  There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  Andthere's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of hisbed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip offthe chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to thepunkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jimcould a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't beno use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_the difficulties.  Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we canwith the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing--there's morehonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it wastheir duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of yourown head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When youcome down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern'sresky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,I believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something tomake a saw out of the first chance we get.”“What do we want of a saw?”“What do we _want_ of it?  Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bedoff, so as to get the chain loose?”“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chainoff.”“Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn.  You _can_ get up theinfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain't you ever readany books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting aprisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all thebest authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it justso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt andgrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't seeno sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slipoff your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch yourrope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in themoat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--andthere's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up andfling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, orNavarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moatto this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.”I says:“What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from underthe cabin?”But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He hadhis chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes hishead; then sighs again, and says:“No, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it.”“For what?”  I says.“Why, to saw Jim's leg off,” he says.“Good land!”  I says; “why, there ain't _no_ necessity for it.  And whatwould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”“Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn't get thechain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg wouldbe better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain't necessityenough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn'tunderstand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; sowe'll let it go.  But there's one thing--he can have a rope ladder; wecan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And wecan send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way.  And I've etworse pies.”“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain't got no use for arope ladder.”“He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don'tknow nothing about it.  He's _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.”“What in the nation can he _do_ with it?”“_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can't he?”  That's what theyall do; and _he's_ got to, too.  Huck, you don't ever seem to want to doanything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all thetime. S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews? Of course they will.  And you wouldn't leave them any?  That would be a_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn't_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.”“Well,” I says, “if it's in the regulations, and he's got to haveit, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on noregulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing upour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into troublewith Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born.  Now, the way I look atit, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing,and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had noexperience, and so he don't care what kind of a--”“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keepstill--that's what I'D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escapingby a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.”“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take myadvice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.”He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:“Borrow a shirt, too.”“What do we want of a shirt, Tom?”“Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.”“Journal your granny--_Jim_ can't write.”“S'pose he _can't_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, ifwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old ironbarrel-hoop?”“Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a betterone; and quicker, too.”“_Prisoners_ don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pullpens out of, you muggins.  They _always_ make their pens out of thehardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick orsomething like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeksand weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they've gotto do it by rubbing it on the wall.  _They_ wouldn't use a goose-quillif they had it. It ain't regular.”“Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?”“Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sortand women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that;and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious messageto let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on thebottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  TheIron Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too.”“Jim ain't got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan.”“That ain't nothing; we can get him some.”“Can't nobody _read_ his plates.”“That ain't got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.  All _he's_ got todo is to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don't _have_ to beable to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisonerwrites on a tin plate, or anywhere else.”“Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?”“Why, blame it all, it ain't the _prisoner's_ plates.”“But it's _somebody's_ plates, ain't it?”“Well, spos'n it is?  What does the _prisoner_ care whose--”He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So wecleared out for the house.Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of theclothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we wentdown and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn'tborrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; andprisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobodydon't blame them for it, either.  It ain't no crime in a prisoner tosteal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; andso, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right tosteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselvesout of prison with.  He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a verydifferent thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal whenhe warn't a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there wasthat come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and hemade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what itwas for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn'tneed it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was. He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jimto kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go atthat, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisonerif I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions likethat every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settleddown to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom hecarried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keepwatch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpileto talk.  He says:“Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.”“Tools?”  I says.“Yes.”“Tools for what?”“Why, to dig with.  We ain't a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?”“Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig anigger out with?”  I says.He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:“Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--whatkind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?  Why, they might aswell lend him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, theywouldn't furnish 'em to a king.”“Well, then,” I says, “if we don't want the picks and shovels, what dowe want?”“A couple of case-knives.”“To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?”“Yes.”“Confound it, it's foolish, Tom.”“It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the _right_ way--andit's the regular way.  And there ain't no _other_ way, that ever I heardof, and I've read all the books that gives any information about thesethings. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mindyou; generly it's through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeksand weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners inthe bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, thatdug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?”“I don't know.”“Well, guess.”“I don't know.  A month and a half.”“_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China.  _That's_ the kind.  Iwish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.”“_Jim_ don't know nobody in China.”“What's _that_ got to do with it?  Neither did that other fellow.  Butyou're always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why can't you stick tothe main point?”“All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jimdon't, either, I reckon.  But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old tobe dug out with a case-knife.  He won't last.”“Yes he will _last_, too.  You don't reckon it's going to takethirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?”“How long will it take, Tom?”“Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn'ttake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He'll hear Jim ain't from there.  Then his next move will be toadvertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can't resk being as longdigging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to bea couple of years; but we can't.  Things being so uncertain, what Irecommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at itthirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away thefirst time there's an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.”“Now, there's _sense_ in that,” I says.  “Letting on don't cost nothing;letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mindletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn't strainme none, after I got my hand in.  So I'll mosey along now, and smouch acouple of case-knives.”“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”“Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says,“there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under theweather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:“It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along andsmouch the knives--three of them.”  So I done it."

    "text": "AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down thelightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out ourpile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of theway, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tomsaid he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, andwhen we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know therewas any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to theground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and thenwe was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't seewe'd done anything hardly.  At last I says:“This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,Tom Sawyer.”He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stoppeddigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.Then he says:“It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.  If we was prisonersit would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and nohurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, whilethey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, andwe could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,and the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can't fool along; we got torush; we ain't got no time to spare.  If we was to put in anothernight this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands getwell--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.”“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”“I'll tell you.  It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't likeit to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig himout with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.”“_Now_ you're _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and levelerall the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or nomoral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-schoolbook, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.  What Iwant is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is mySunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thingI'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-schoolbook out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinksabout it nuther.”“Well,” he says, “there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case likethis; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand byand see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant andknows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but itwouldn't for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.”He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, andsays:“Gimme a _case-knife_.”I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched aroundamongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he tookit and went to work, and never said a word.He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was aslong as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show forit. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doinghis level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, hishands was so sore.  At last he says:“It ain't no use, it can't be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can'tyou think of no way?”“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain't regular.  Come up the stairs, andlet on it's a lightning-rod.”So he done it.Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and Ihung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tinplates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever seethe plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fenneland jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back andhe could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heardof such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by hesaid he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need todecide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and tookone of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heardJim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then wewhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a halfthe job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, andpawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentleand gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called ushoney, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having ushunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him howunregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; andnot to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over oldtimes awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim toldhim Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and AuntSally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, andboth of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:“_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by them.”I said, “Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackassideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went righton.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and otherlarge things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on thelookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; andwe would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal themout; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in herapron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be andwhat they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt withhis blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't seeno sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowedbetter than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all justas Tom said.Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down goodsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home tobed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in highspirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and themost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we wouldkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children toget out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better themore he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung outto as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And hesaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brasscandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon inhis pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat'snotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of acorn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see howit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it mostmashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a workedbetter. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was onlyjust a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting intobread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what hejabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes acouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept onpiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly roomin there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-todoor!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeledover on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he wasdying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and backagain and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, andasking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,and blinked his eyes around, and says:“Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most amillion dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in desetracks.  I did, mos' sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; deywas all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on oneer dem witches jis' wunst--on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast.  But mos'lyI wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does.”Tom says:“Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at thisrunaway nigger's breakfast-time?  It's because they're hungry; that'sthe reason.  You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for _you_ todo.”“But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie?  I doan'know how to make it.  I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'.”“Well, then, I'll have to make it myself.”“Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot,I will!”“All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us andshowed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  Whenwe come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in thepan, don't you let on you see it at all.  And don't you look when Jimunloads the pan--something might happen, I don't know what.  And aboveall, don't you _handle_ the witch-things.”“_Hannel 'M_, Mars Sid?  What _is_ you a-talkin' 'bout?  I wouldn'lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billiondollars, I wouldn't.”"

    "text": "THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pilein the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and piecesof bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratchedaround and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well aswe could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it fullof flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nailsthat Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name andsorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in AuntSally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuckin the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because weheard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger'shouse this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped thepewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't comeyet, so we had to wait a little while.And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardlywait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with onehand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with theother, and says:“I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_become of your other shirt.”My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hardpiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on theroad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of thechildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cryout of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue aroundthe gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things forabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold outfor half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all rightagain--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.Uncle Silas he says:“It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it.  I know perfectlywell I took it _off_, because--”“Because you hain't got but one _on_.  Just _listen_ at the man!  I knowyou took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-getheringmemory, too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday--I see it theremyself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'lljust have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make anew one. And it 'll be the third I've made in two years.  It just keepsa body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to_do_ with 'm all is more'n I can make out.  A body 'd think you _would_learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life.”“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn't to bealtogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor havenothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believeI've ever lost one of them _off_ of me.”“Well, it ain't _your_ fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done itif you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther. Ther's a spoon gone; and _that_ ain't all.  There was ten, and nowther's only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf nevertook the spoon, _that's_ certain.”“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”“Ther's six _candles_ gone--that's what.  The rats could a got thecandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with thewhole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don'tdo it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas--_you'd_never find it out; but you can't lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that Iknow.”“Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; butI won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”“Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta_Phelps!_”Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of thesugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman stepson to the passage, and says:“Missus, dey's a sheet gone.”“A _sheet_ gone!  Well, for the land's sake!”“I'll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.“Oh, _do_ shet up!--s'pose the rats took the _sheet_?  _where's_ it gone,Lize?”“Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally.  She wuz on declo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain' dah no mo' now.”“I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.  I _never_ see the beat of itin all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--”“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey's a brass cannelstickmiss'n.”“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!”Well, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckonedI would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  Shekept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, andeverybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, lookingkind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was inJeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:“It's _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;and like as not you've got the other things there, too.  How'd it getthere?”“I reely don't know, Sally,” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you knowI would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen beforebreakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to putmy Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; butI'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know Ididn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down andtook up the spoon, and--”“Oh, for the land's sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go 'long now, the wholekit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back mypeace of mind.”I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking itout; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead.  As we waspassing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and theshingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up andlaid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tomsee him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:“Well, it ain't no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain'treliable.” Then he says:  “But he done us a good turn with the spoon,anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without _him_knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.”There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a wholehour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heardsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comesthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candleand thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,saying:“Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.  I couldshow her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats.  But nevermind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn't do no good.”And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was amighty nice old man.  And always is.Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he saidwe'd got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it outhe told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around thespoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went tocounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one ofthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.”She says:“Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I counted'm myself.”“Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.”She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybodywould.“I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what inthe world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.”So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, shesays:“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!” and she looked huffyand bothered both.  But Tom says:“Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.”“You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_”“I know, but--”“Well, I'll count 'm _again_.”So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was somad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd startto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times theycome out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbedup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the catgalley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and ifwe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skinus.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilstshe was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, alongwith her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied withthis business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alikeagain to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right ifshe _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for thenext three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybodythat wanted her to ever count them any more.So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out ofher closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for acouple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of hersoul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;she druther die first.So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoonand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-upcounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it wouldblow over by and by.But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  Wefixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got itdone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and wehad to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, andwe got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out withthe smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and wecouldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of coursewe thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and toreup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and longbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a personwith.  We let on it took nine months to make it.And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't gointo the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was ropeenough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left overfor soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a wholedinner.But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, andso we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the pies in thewash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noblebrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belongedto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over fromEngland with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them earlyships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and thingsthat was valuable, not on account of being any account, because theywarn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snakedher out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the firstpies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the lastone.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, andloaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down thelid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the longhandle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out apie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it wouldwant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that ropeladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'mtalking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till nexttime, too.Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put thethree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jimgot everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he bustedinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of thewindow-hole."

    "text": "MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jimallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That's theone which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to haveit; Tom said he'd _got_ to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner notscrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at oldNorthumberland!  Why, Huck, s'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--whatyou going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim's _got_ to do hisinscription and coat of arms.  They all do.”Jim says:“Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dishyer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”“Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”“Well,” I says, “Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coatof arms, because he hain't.”“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he'll have one beforehe goes out of this--because he's going out _right_, and there ain'tgoing to be no flaws in his record.”So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jima-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he'dstruck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but therewas one which he reckoned he'd decide on.  He says:“On the scutcheon we'll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and underhis foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in achief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with thenombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and acouple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _MaggioreFretta, Minore Otto._  Got it out of a book--means the more haste theless speed.”“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”“We ain't got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig inlike all git-out.”“Well, anyway,” I says, “what's _some_ of it?  What's a fess?”“A fess--a fess is--_you_ don't need to know what a fess is.  I'll showhim how to make it when he gets to it.”“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person.  What's a barsinister?”“Oh, I don't know.  But he's got to have it.  All the nobility does.”That was just his way.  If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you,he wouldn't do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make nodifference.He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in tofinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out amournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  Hemade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook bythe world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonelyheart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-sevenyears of solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, afterthirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,natural son of Louis XIV.Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jimto scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowedhe would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him ayear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and hedidn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would blockthem out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but justfollow the lines.  Then pretty soon he says:“Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log wallsin a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We'll fetcha rock.”Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take himsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look tosee how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most peskytedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to getwell of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tomsays:“I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms andmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it,and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,too.”It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstonenuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it.  It warn't quite midnight yet,so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched thegrindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation toughjob. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from fallingover, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she wasgoing to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her halfway; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  Wesee it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up hisbed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and roundhis neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jimand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; andTom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  Heknowed how to do everything.Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstonethrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tommarked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in thelean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candlequit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone underhis straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain backon the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought ofsomething, and says:“You got any spiders in here, Jim?”“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom.”“All right, we'll get you some.”“But bless you, honey, I doan' _want_ none.  I's afeard un um.  I jis''s soon have rattlesnakes aroun'.”Tom thought a minute or two, and says:“It's a good idea.  And I reckon it's been done.  It _must_ a been done;it stands to reason.  Yes, it's a prime good idea.  Where could you keepit?”“Keep what, Mars Tom?”“Why, a rattlesnake.”“De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake tocome in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, widmy head.”“Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.  You could tameit.”“_Tame_ it!”“Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,and they wouldn't _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  Any bookwill tell you that.  You try--that's all I ask; just try for two or threedays. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he'll love you;and sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will letyou wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.”“_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_' talk so!  I can't _stan_' it!  He'd _let_me shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain't it?  I lay he'd wait apow'ful long time 'fo' I _ast_ him.  En mo' en dat, I doan' _want_ himto sleep wid me.”“Jim, don't act so foolish.  A prisoner's _got_ to have some kind of adumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's moreglory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any otherway you could ever think of to save your life.”“Why, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no sich glory.  Snake take 'n biteJim's chin off, den _whah_ is de glory?  No, sah, I doan' want no sichdoin's.”“Blame it, can't you _try_?  I only _want_ you to try--you needn't keepit up if it don't work.”“But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him.Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable,but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I'sgwyne to _leave_, dat's _shore_.”“Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it. We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons ontheir tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll haveto do.”“I k'n stan' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widoutum, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother andtrouble to be a prisoner.”“Well, it _always_ is when it's done right.  You got any rats aroundhere?”“No, sah, I hain't seed none.”“Well, we'll get you some rats.”“Why, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no rats.  Dey's de dadblamedest cretursto 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he'stryin' to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I'sgot to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um,skasely.”“But, Jim, you _got_ to have 'em--they all do.  So don't make no morefuss about it.  Prisoners ain't ever without rats.  There ain't noinstance of it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn themtricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to playmusic to them.  You got anything to play music on?”“I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp.”“Yes they would _they_ don't care what kind of music 'tis.  Ajews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music--in aprison they dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can't get noother kind out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come outto see what's the matter with you.  Yes, you're all right; you're fixedvery well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Linkis Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anythingelse; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats,and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,and come.  And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble goodtime.”“Yes, _dey_ will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I'll do it ef I got to.  Ireck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in dehouse.”Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; andpretty soon he says:“Oh, there's one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do youreckon?”“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sighto' trouble.”“Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it.”“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, MarsTom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss.”“Don't you believe it.  We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it inthe corner over there, and raise it.  And don't call it mullen, call itPitchiola--that's its right name when it's in a prison.  And you want towater it with your tears.”“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”“You don't _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It's the way they always do.”“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste widspring water whiles another man's a _start'n_ one wid tears.”“That ain't the idea.  You _got_ to do it with tears.”“She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skaselyever cry.”So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim wouldhave to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promisedhe would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim'scoffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis' 's soon havetobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with thework and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, andpetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top ofall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility tobe a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost allpatience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudierchances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name forhimself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they wasjust about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn'tbehave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed."

    "text": "IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap andfetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hourwe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and putit in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.  But while we was gone forspiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps foundit there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she wasa-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing whatthey could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dustedus both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catchinganother fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn'tthe likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, andcaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet'snest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We didn't give it rightup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'dtire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then wegot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all rightagain, but couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them ina bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, anda rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn'thalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn'tmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  Sowe judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn't no realscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You'd seethem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and theygenerly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and mostof the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome andstriped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that nevermade no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed whatthey might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; andevery time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no differencewhat she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  Inever see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  Youcouldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And ifshe turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift ahowl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the oldman so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakescreated.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of thehouse for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn'tnear over it; when she was setting thinking about something you couldtouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jumpright out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said allwomen was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason orother.We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and sheallowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we everloaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind the lickings,because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble wehad to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the otherthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'dall swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make itmighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakesand the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; andwhen there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it wasalways lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, buttook turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, andwhen the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had onegang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance athim as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn'tever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim hewould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on thegrindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was allgoing to die, but didn't.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I eversee; and Tom said the same.But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we wasall pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrotea couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get theirrunaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no suchplantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis andNew Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give methe cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, nowfor the nonnamous letters.“What's them?”  I says.“Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it's done oneway, sometimes another.  But there's always somebody spying around thatgives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was goingto light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very goodway, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it'susual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and shestays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too.”“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for thatsomething's up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it's theirlookout.”“Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've actedfrom the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They're so confidingand mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.  So if wedon't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interferewith us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll gooff perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be nothing _to_ it.”“Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.”“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:“But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suitsme. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”“You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook thatyaller girl's frock.”“Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, sheprob'bly hain't got any but that one.”“I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry thenonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”“All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in myown togs.”“You wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”“No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”“That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is justto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it ornot. Hain't you got no principle at all?”“All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.  Who's Jim'smother?”“I'm his mother.  I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”“Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.”“Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bedto represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman'sgown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When aprisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always calledso when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son;it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnaturalone.”So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench'sfrock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, theway Tom told me to.  It said:Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull andcrossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin onthe back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn't abeen worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for thembehind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  Ifa door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!” if anything fell,she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when shewarn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and besatisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her everytime--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” andbefore she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say itagain; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So thething was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing workmore satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at thestreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what webetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was goingto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down thelightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This lettersaid:Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang ofcutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runawaynigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you willstay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but havegot religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, andwill betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in thenigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin hornif I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon asthey get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting hischains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at yourleasure.  Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you dothey will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wishany reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._"

    "text": "WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and wentover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took alook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end theywas standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was donesupper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on aword about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as muchabout it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and herback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a goodlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up abouthalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole andwas going to start with the lunch, but says:“Where's the butter?”“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone.”“Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain't here.”“We can get along without it,” I says.“We can get along _with_ it, too,” he says; “just you slide down cellarand fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and comealong. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent hismother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon asyou get there.”So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big asa person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab ofcorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairsvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comesAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clappedmy hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:“You been down cellar?”“Yes'm.”“What you been doing down there?”“Noth'n.”“_Noth'n!_”“No'm.”“Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?”“I don't know 'm.”“You don't _know_?  Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know whatyou been _doing_ down there.”“I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if Ihave.”I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but Is'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweatabout every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,very decided:“You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  Youbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what itis before I'M done with you.”So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of themhad a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't;but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing theirseats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself, but Ididn't take my hat off, all the same.I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, ifshe wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone thisthing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, sowe could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim beforethese rips got out of patience and come for us.At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn't_ answerthem straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these menwas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW andlay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes tomidnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for thesheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, andme a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I wasthat scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butterbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and prettysoon, when one of them says, “I'M for going and getting in the cabin_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,” I mostdropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, andAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:“For the land's sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?  He's got thebrain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!”And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comesthe bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, andhugged me, and says:“Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am itain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours,and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed bythe color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,dear, whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you'd been down there for, Iwouldn't a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more ofyou till morning!”I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn't hardly get mywords out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we mustjump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,with guns!His eyes just blazed; and he says:“No!--is that so?  _ain't_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do overagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--”“Hurry!  _Hurry_!”  I says.  “Where's Jim?”“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He's dressed, and everything's ready.  Now we'll slide out and give thesheep-signal.”But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard thembegin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:“I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in thedark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,and listen if you can hear 'em coming.”So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod onus whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under allright, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in thelean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't makeout nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listenfor the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide outfirst, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, andlistened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there allthe time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthytowards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jimover it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the toprail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, whichsnapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracksand started somebody sings out:“Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!”But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then therewas a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzedaround us! We heard them sing out:“Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em, boys, and turnloose the dogs!”So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they woreboots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell.  We wasin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us wedodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behindthem.  They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off therobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here theycome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so westopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn'tnobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just saidhowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; andthen we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearlyto the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe wastied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of theriver, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then westruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; andwe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down thebank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And whenwe stepped on to the raft I says:“_Now_, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be aslave no more.”“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It 'uz planned beautiful, enit 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat's mo'mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.”We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all becausehe had a bullet in the calf of his leg.When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we didbefore. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him inthe wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, buthe says:“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don't stop now; don't fool aroundhere, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and sether loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--'deed we did.  I wish _we'd_ ahad the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of SaintLouis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we'da whooped him over the _border_--that's what we'd a done with _him_--anddone it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man thesweeps!”But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we'd thought aminute, I says:“Say it, Jim.”So he says:“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uzbein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go onen save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?'  Is dat likeMars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn't!  _well_,den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n displace 'dout a _doctor_, not if it's forty year!”I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say--soit was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it andwouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loosehimself; but we wouldn't let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,but it didn't do no good.So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:“Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when youget to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight andfast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a pursefull of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around theback alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in thecanoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and takehis chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get himback to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find itagain. It's the way they all do.”So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when hesee the doctor coming till he was gone again."

    "text": "THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I gothim up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island huntingyesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and aboutmidnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off andshot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it andnot say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted tocome home this evening and surprise the folks.“Who is your folks?” he says.“The Phelpses, down yonder.”“Oh,” he says.  And after a minute, he says:“How'd you say he got shot?”“He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.”“Singular dream,” he says.So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  Butwhen he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was bigenough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:“Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easyenough.”“What three?”“Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that's what I mean.”“Oh,” he says.But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they wasall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to waittill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I bettergo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  ButI said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then hestarted.I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fixthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--layaround there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what_I'll_ do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got togo any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tiehim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's donewith him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let himget ashore.So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time Iwaked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for thedoctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some timeor other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful badfor Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas'sstomach! He says:“Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?”“I hain't been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the runawaynigger--me and Sid.”“Why, where ever did you go?” he says.  “Your aunt's been mightyuneasy.”“She needn't,” I says, “because we was all right.  We followed the menand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought weheard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them andcrossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised alongup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoeand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then wepaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to seewhat he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat forus, and then we're going home.”So then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as Isuspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of theoffice, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old mansaid, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got donefooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn't get him to let me stayand wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must comealong, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed andcried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern thatdon't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner;and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was theworst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:“Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lievethe nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell--didn't I, SisterDamrell?--s'I, he's crazy, s'I--them's the very words I said.  You allhearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.  Look at that-airgrindstone, s'I; want to tell _me_'t any cretur 't's in his right mind's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I? Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' sopegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that--natcherl son o' Louissomebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage.  He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's whatI says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's whatI says last 'n' all the time--the nigger's crazy--crazy 's Nebokoodneezer,s'I.”“An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,” saysold Mrs. Damrell; “what in the name o' goodness _could_ he ever wantof--”“The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to SisterUtterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air ragladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, _look_ at it, s'I--what _could_ he a-wantedof it, s'I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--”“But how in the nation'd they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,_anyway_? 'n' who dug that-air _hole_? 'n' who--”“My very _words_, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin'--pass that-air sasser o'm'lasses, won't ye?--I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,how _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s'I.  Without _help_, mindyou--'thout _help_!  _that's_ wher 'tis.  Don't tell _me_, s'I; there_wuz_ help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s'I; ther's ben a_dozen_ a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger onthis place but _I'd_ find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I--”“A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn't a done every thing that's beendone. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've beenmade; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men;look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at--”“You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower!  It's jist as I was a-sayin'to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S'e, what do _you_ think of it, SisterHotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?  Think o' that bed-legsawed off that a way, s'e?  _think_ of it, s'I?  I lay it never sawed_itself_ off, s'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s'I; that's my opinion, take itor leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's myopinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him _do_it, s'I, that's all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I--”“Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in thereevery night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Lookat that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret Africanwrit'n done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, allthe time, amost.  Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n'as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll--”“People to _help_ him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you'd _think_so if you'd a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they've stoleeverything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for thatsheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling howmany times they _didn't_ steal that; and flour, and candles, andcandlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousandthings that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me andSilas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I wasa-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sightnor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, theyslides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with thatnigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogsright on their very heels at that very time!  I tell you, it just bangsanything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn't a done better andbeen no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even goton the _track_ of 'm once!  You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_of you!”“Well, it does beat--”“Laws alive, I never--”“So help me, I wouldn't a be--”“_House_-thieves as well as--”“Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a--”“'Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, orget up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they'd stealthe very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I wasin by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn'tafraid they'd steal some o' the family!  I was just to that pass Ididn't have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boysasleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodnessI was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!  I _did_.  Andanybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and itkeeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and yourwits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things,and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away upthere, and the door ain't locked, and you--” She stopped, looking kindof wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eyelit on me--I got up and took a walk.Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in thatroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So I done it.  But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me.  And whenit was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in andtold her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door waslocked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try _that_no more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silasbefore; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all rightenough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boyswas a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as longas no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her timebeing grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead offretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and pattedme on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and prettysoon jumps up, and says:“Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!  What _has_become of that boy?”I see my chance; so I skips up and says:“I'll run right up to town and get him,” I says.“No you won't,” she says.  “You'll stay right wher' you are; _one's_enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'llgo.”Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom'strack. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he saidthere warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'llsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she hadto be satisfied.  But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, andkeep a light burning so he could see it.And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched hercandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and likeI couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talkedwith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn'tseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me everynow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybedrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering ordead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip downsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be homein the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done hergood, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away shelooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:“The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window andthe rod; but you'll be good, _won't_ you?  And you won't go?  For _my_sake.”Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was allintending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped aroundfront, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with hereyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could dosomething for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't neverdo nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up atdawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep."

    "text": "THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get notrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not sayingnothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and noteating anything. And by and by the old man says:“Did I give you the letter?”“What letter?”“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.”“No, you didn't give me no letter.”“Well, I must a forgot it.”So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he hadlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:“Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.”I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.  Butbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she seesomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that olddoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;and a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that comehandy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:“Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!”And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,and says:“He's alive, thank God!  And that's enough!” and she snatched a kiss ofhim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering ordersright and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tonguecould go, every jump of the way.I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and theold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The menwas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example toall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to runaway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping awhole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the otherssaid, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, andhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooledthem down a little, because the people that's always the most anxiousfor to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the veryones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got theirsatisfaction out of him.They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side thehead once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on toknow me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clotheson him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but toa big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, andboth legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water toeat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction becausehe didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, andsaid a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about thecabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; andabout this time they was through with the job and was tapering off witha kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes andtakes a look, and says:“Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain'ta bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cutthe bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition forme to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a littleworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't letme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd killme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't doanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; andthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and sayshe'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course Ijudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I hadto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  Itwas a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, andof course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yetnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stickplumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was abetter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been workedmain hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, anigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  Ihad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as hewould a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till aboutdawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luckwould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head proppedon his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slippedup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he wasabout, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of aflighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, andtowed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the leastrow nor said a word from the start.  He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen;that's what I think about him.”Somebody says:“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.”Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankfulto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it wasaccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a goodheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then theyall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have somenotice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right outand hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say hecould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rottenheavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but theydidn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, butI judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other assoon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead ofme--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shotwhen I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddlingaround hunting the runaway nigger.But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all dayand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodgedhim.Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said AuntSally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if Ifound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family thatwould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; andpale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down andlaid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes glidingin, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, andset down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyfulnow, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleepinglike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all thetime, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened hiseyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:“Hello!--why, I'm at _home_!  How's that?  Where's the raft?”“It's all right,” I says.“And _Jim_?”“The same,” I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash.  But he nevernoticed, but says:“Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”“What whole thing?”“Why, _the_ whole thing.  There ain't but one; how we set the runawaynigger free--me and Tom.”“Good land!  Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about!  Dear, dear,out of his head again!”“_No_, I ain't out of my _head_; I know all what I'm talking about.  We_did_ set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it. And we done it elegant, too.”  He'd got a start, and she never checkedhim up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, andI see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us apower of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you wasall asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and thewarming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,and you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, andinscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ thefun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down thelightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladderand send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to workwith in your apron pocket--”“Mercy sakes!”“--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company forJim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat thatyou come near spiling the whole business, because the men come beforewe was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and letdrive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and letthem go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, butwent for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for theraft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all byourselves, and _wasn't_ it bully, Aunty!”“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was_you_, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble,and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most todeath.  I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it outo' you this very minute.  To think, here I've been, night after night,a--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the OldHarry out o' both o' ye!”But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn't_ hold in,and his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire allalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and shesays:“_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind Itell you if I catch you meddling with him again--”“Meddling with _who_?”  Tom says, dropping his smile and lookingsurprised.“With _who_?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who'd you reckon?”Tom looks at me very grave, and says:“Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn't he got away?”“_Him_?” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger?  'Deed he hasn't. They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again,on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed orsold!”Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils openingand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:“They hain't no _right_ to shut him up!  SHOVE!--and don't you lose aminute.  Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any creturthat walks this earth!”“What _does_ the child mean?”“I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, _I'll_go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old MissWatson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going tosell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in herwill.”“Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he wasalready free?”“Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why,I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in bloodto--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_”If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking assweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, andcried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peepedout, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose andstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grindinghim into the earth, you know.  And then she says:“Yes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.”“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain't_Tom_, it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minuteago.”“You mean where's Huck _Finn_--that's what you mean!  I reckon I hain'traised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I_see_ him.  That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under thatbed, Huck Finn.”So I done it.  But not feeling brash.Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I eversee--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they toldit all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn'tknow nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meetingsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because theoldest man in the world couldn't a understood it.  So Tom's Aunt Polly,she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell howI was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for TomSawyer--she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'mused to it now, and 'tain't no need to change”--that when Aunt Sally tookme for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, andI knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, beinga mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectlysatisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and madethings as soft as he could for me.And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson settingJim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and tookall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn'tever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:“Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off thatway without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse allthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what thatcreetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get anyanswer out of you about it.”“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.“Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could meanby Sid being here.”“Well, I never got 'em, Sis.”Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:“You, Tom!”“Well--_what_?” he says, kind of pettish.“Don't you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.”“What letters?”“_Them_ letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll--”“They're in the trunk.  There, now.  And they're just the same as theywas when I got them out of the office.  I hain't looked into them, Ihain't touched them.  But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought ifyou warn't in no hurry, I'd--”“Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.  And Iwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he--”“No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but _it's_ all right, I'vegot that one.”I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe itwas just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing."

    "text": "THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, timeof the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked allright and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we gotJim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, andhave adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him abouthis being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out allthe niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlightprocession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so wouldwe.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and UncleSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give himall he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we hadhim up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim fortydollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:“Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jacksonislan'?  I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; enI _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it'scome true; en heah she is!  _dah_, now! doan' talk to _me_--signs is_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter berich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!”And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all threeslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go forhowling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for acouple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but Iain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't getnone from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and gotit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.“No, he hain't,” Tom says; “it's all there yet--six thousand dollarsand more; and your pap hain't ever been back since.  Hadn't when I comeaway, anyhow.”Jim says, kind of solemn:“He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.”I says:“Why, Jim?”“Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain't comin' back no mo.”But I kept at him; so at last he says:“Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz aman in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let youcome in?  Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase datwuz him.”Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guardfor a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain'tnothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'da knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it,and ain't a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for theTerritory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt meand sivilize me, and I can't stand it.  I been there before.THE END. YOURS TRULY, _HUCK FINN_."
